## Organization
### Overview
23people's organizational structure is designed for agility and clear accountability. It is composed of functional **Teams** responsible for core business operations, cross-functional **Tribes** that focus on specific client projects or service lines, and strategic **Councils** for governance and decision-making. This structure is supported by a defined **Workforce Structure** that distinguishes between formal positions and operational roles.

### Teams
The company is organized into four primary functional teams:
- **Tech Talent Services (TTS):** This team is responsible for all aspects of technology talent acquisition, management, and development. It manages the recruitment pipeline, professional growth, and allocation of technical professionals to projects and client teams. TTS tracks talent acquisition KPIs including forecasting metrics.
- **Sales & Marketing (SMKT):** This team drives business growth by managing client relationships, prospecting new opportunities, and communicating our value proposition. They follow structured workflows for prospecting and consultative sales and manage key KPI areas for client relationships.
- **Backoffice (BKO):** The BKO team provides the essential operational backbone for the company. Its functions are grouped into three service categories: **People Management**, **Financial Management**, and **Services Management**. This team ensures smooth administrative, financial, and internal service operations.
- **Research & Development (R&D):** This team focuses on innovation, exploring new technologies, and developing internal tools and frameworks. It drives our technical strategy and ensures we stay at the forefront of industry trends.

### Tribes
Tribes are cross-functional groups that bring together members from different teams to focus on a specific client, project, or long-term initiative. They function as semi-autonomous units to deliver value and maintain alignment with client goals. The primary tribes are:
- **Iarvis Tribe**
- **Drakkar Tribe**

### Councils
Councils are governing bodies responsible for strategic decision-making, setting standards, and ensuring alignment with our core principles. They operate at different levels of the organization. Key councils include:
- **Founders Council**
- **High Council**
- **Iarvis Council**

### Workforce Structure
Our workforce is defined by a dual structure of **Positions** and **Roles**. A **Position** is a formal job title within the company's hierarchy (e.g., Operations Director), while a **Role** is a set of responsibilities and accountabilities related to a specific function or workflow (e.g., Service Delivery Manager). This allows individuals to hold a formal position while taking on various operational roles across teams or projects, providing flexibility and clarity.

### Learning

We support professional development through various means, including reimbursements for courses and international certifications, as well as internal training programs like English classes. This commitment ensures our team members' skills remain sharp and relevant.
