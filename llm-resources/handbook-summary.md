## About Us
### Who We Are (https://manual.23people.io/about-us/who-we-are/)
23people is a technology company founded in 2014 with the vision of creating an ideal workplace for professionals passionate about technology. We are a team dedicated to building a sustainable business model that prioritizes people, both clients and employees, fostering a culture of collaboration, respect, and continuous learning. Our name is inspired by "The Matrix," symbolizing the spirit of those chosen to rebuild Zion, reflecting our mission to build something exceptional in the tech world.

### What We Do (https://manual.23people.io/about-us/what-we-do/)
We act as reliable technology facilitators and co-creators for companies undergoing digital evolution. Our services are designed to help clients enhance their digital products and services by integrating top tech talent, software engineering best practices, and advanced technologies with their business knowledge and data. We offer three main service lines: **Tech Talent Outsourcing and Recruiting**, **Digital Platforms, Cloud & Modernization**, and **Data, Advanced Analytics & AI**.

### What Sets Us Apart (https://manual.23people.io/about-us/how-we-work/)
Our differentiation lies in *how* we do things, based on five fundamental pillars. We **specialize in exceptional Tech Roles**, focusing on professionals who are passionate and proven in their fields. We have an **optimized Tech Recruitment process** to find and validate these talents. Our teams demonstrate **maturity in software development**, building agile and data-driven solutions. We master both **enterprise and emerging technologies**, and above all, we are committed to **customer satisfaction**, accompanying our clients at every step.

### What We Pursue (https://manual.23people.io/about-us/what-we-pursue/goals/)
Our strategic goals focus on three key areas. First, we aim to be a **benchmark in technology and professional growth for tech talent**, consolidating our position in Latin America. Second, we pursue **sustainable economic growth and globalization**, becoming a reference that other companies admire for our operational excellence and high talent retention. Finally, we seek to **innovate with digital products based on data and AI**, leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance our human capabilities and build efficient, attractive solutions.

## Organization
### Overview (https://manual.23people.io/organization/)
23people is organized in a circular structure of multidisciplinary teams to foster collaboration and clear communication. Each team operates with autonomy around a well-defined purpose, delivering services to internal teams or external clients through explicit service contracts, similar to software **APIs**. This model emphasizes data-driven iterative improvement, allowing teams to enhance service quality and operational efficiency. The entire structure is designed to support both technical and management career paths while aligning daily tasks with long-term strategic goals.

### Teams (https://manual.23people.io/organization/)
Our operational structure consists of four core teams, each with a specific purpose and a set of services they provide.
- **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in recruiting, validating, and retaining tech professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
- **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand, presence, and market share.
- **Backoffice (BKO)**: Provides the best administrative support, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions through agile and efficient management of people, finances, and company operations.
- **Research & Development (R&D)**: Powers our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real value in their operations.

### Tribes (https://manual.23people.io/organization/tribes/)
Teams at 23people are grouped into two **Tribes** that share common objectives and identities.
- **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to drive the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with the company's strategic goals through effective collaboration.
- **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all teams and professionals working on an outsourcing basis for our clients, either as dedicated teams or as individual contributors. Its purpose is to ensure we have the right talent to meet client needs effectively.

### Councils
23people utilizes councils for strategic alignment and governance. The **High Council** is a strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy, ensuring that all operational teams are aligned with it. The **Iarvis Council**, led by the Global Operations Manager, is in charge of coordinating and aligning the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

### Workforce Structure (https://manual.23people.io/organization/)
Our organizational structure distinguishes between permanent positions (**Cargos**) and dynamic assignments (**Roles**). A **Cargo** is a formal, permanent position defining a professional's level (Entry, Intermediate, Senior), core competencies, and career path. A **Rol** is a specific, flexible scope of action with concrete responsibilities that a professional takes on within a team or project. A single person in one Cargo can perform multiple Roles across different teams, allowing for flexibility and multidisciplinary application of their core skills.

## Principles
### Fundamental Principles (https://manual.23people.io/principles/fundamentals/)
- **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are eternal learners who pursue excellence in our work. We embrace an iterative, data-driven, and methodical approach to continuously improve our skills and knowledge.
- **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We support each other genuinely through honest transparency and assertive communication. We work as a team, sharing responsibilities and celebrating victories together, believing that collaboration is superior to individual heroism.
- **Sustainable Growth and Reference Status**: We are ambitious about growing economically and becoming international benchmarks, but we do so at a sustainable pace. We prioritize systematic progress over exhausting short-term efforts, ensuring our growth is not at the expense of our people, clients, or planet.

### Culture and People Principles (https://manual.23people.io/principles/culture-and-people/)
- **People First**: We work to live, not the other way around. Our company was founded on the dream of creating a place where we ourselves would want to work, prioritizing human well-being, respect, and empathy. We believe motivated individuals are more effective than stressed ones.
- **Equity**: We believe in a humane and motivating company where everyone is treated with respect and equality. We avoid all forms of discrimination in our selection processes, as we believe talent is distributed uniformly throughout society.
- **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction. Whether with clients, tech professionals, administrative staff, or suppliers, we aim to deliver exceptional quality and build lasting relationships based on value and mutual respect.

### Operational Principles (https://manual.23people.io/principles/operationals/)
- **Agility**: We adhere to agile values, prioritizing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. This allows us to adapt quickly, maintain continuous improvement cycles, and remain resilient.
- **Transparency**: We are committed to making our practices and processes accessible and verifiable. All information is public by default, with exceptions only for sensitive client, employee, or supplier data, fostering trust and productivity.
- **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We favor remote work, 100% digital and cloud-based operations, and technologies that reduce our environmental impact.

## Practices
### Agile Management (https://manual.23people.io/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people/)
We practice the principle of **managing the work, not the people**. Using Kanban-based visual workflows, we focus on optimizing the flow of tasks from request to completion. Each team maintains its own Kanban board with clear stages (Backlog, Requested, In Progress, Done, Archive) and enforces **Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits** to prevent overload and promote focus. This approach provides transparency, facilitates collaboration, and enables continuous improvement by identifying and resolving bottlenecks.

### Communication (https://manual.23people.io/practices/communication/)
We prefer **asynchronous communication** to allow team members to manage their time effectively and provide thoughtful responses. To ensure clarity, we practice **structuring our narrative** when presenting ideas or problems, using a "Context-Response" format based on the Pyramid Principle. This involves setting the situation and complication before presenting a clear conclusion supported by key arguments. This structured approach minimizes ambiguity and enhances decision-making.

### Learning (https://manual.23people.io/practices/learning/how-to-learn/)
We foster a culture of "learning how to learn." We employ a technique that involves selecting a topic, studying it, and then **explaining it in simple terms as if teaching someone else**. This process helps identify knowledge gaps. If we get stuck, we return to studying. The final step is to simplify the language further, ensuring a deep and lasting understanding. This practice is central to our value of intellectual curiosity.

### Using AI (https://manual.23people.io/practices/using-ai/claude-project/)
We leverage AI as a **capability multiplier**. A key practice is the use of **Claude Projects**, which are dedicated workspaces with pre-defined instructions for specific, recurring tasks. These projects help automate repetitive work, maintain quality standards, and generate structured first drafts for documents, allowing our team to focus on higher-value activities. All AI-generated content is considered a draft that requires professional review, editing, and contextualization.

## Community
### Benefits Framework (https://manual.23people.io/community/benefits/)
23people offers a range of benefits aimed at improving the physical, mental, and professional well-being of its team members. The framework is designed to be comprehensive and accessible to everyone with at least three months of tenure. Benefits are categorized into **Agreements** (e.g., Betterfly wellness app, supplementary health insurance), **Incentives** (e.g., vacation bonus, birthday day-off), **Refunds** (e.g., for courses, certifications, and workspace improvements), and **Trainings** (e.g., English classes).

### Procedures (https://manual.23people.io/community/procedures/administratives/)
To ensure operational consistency, 23people maintains documented administrative procedures. These cover common processes such as **expense reimbursement** and **funding requests**. The procedures are designed to be clear and straightforward, providing team members with the necessary steps to follow for administrative tasks, ensuring transparency and efficiency in our internal operations.

### Events (https://manual.23people.io/community/events/)
Community building is important at 23people. We organize and participate in various events, both internal and external, to foster connection and collaboration among team members. Photographs and videos from these events are stored centrally in a shared Google Drive, accessible to the Marketing and People Growth teams, to preserve and share our collective memories.

## Technical Guide
### Software Development Principles (https://manual.23people.io/technical-guide/software-development/principles/)
Our development philosophy is rooted in **simplicity**. We balance **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for structure with **Functional Programming** concepts for clarity and predictability. We strictly adhere to the **SOLID principles** to build modular, maintainable, and flexible code. Every project is approached with a business-centric focus to ensure we solve real problems, while always designing for scalability and long-term maintainability.

### Methodologies (https://manual.23people.io/technical-guide/software-development/methodologies/)
We primarily use a **Kanban-based agile methodology**. This approach allows for flexibility and continuous flow, which we find superior for adapting to change. We visualize our workflow on Kanban boards, use **WIP (Work-in-Progress) limits** to maintain focus and efficiency, and practice continuous improvement to optimize our processes. While Kanban is our foundation, we adapt and may incorporate other agile practices like sprints or retrospectives when a project requires it.

### Technologies (https://manual.23people.io/technical-guide/software-development/technologies/)
Our technology stack is selected for its mature ecosystem, scalability, and alignment with our principle of simplicity. Our primary technologies include:
- **Backend**: **Node.js** with the **NestJS** framework for modular and maintainable architecture.
- **Frontend**: **React** for building interactive and component-based user interfaces.
- **AI/ML**: **Python**, leveraging its extensive ecosystem of data science libraries.
- **Databases**: **MongoDB** for flexibility with document-oriented data and **PostgreSQL** for robustness and transactional integrity in relational data structures.

### Practices (https://manual.23people.io/technical-guide/software-development/practices/)
We enforce a set of standard practices to ensure high-quality software delivery. All code is managed using **Git** with a structured branching workflow. **Code reviews** are mandatory for all changes to promote quality and knowledge sharing. We maintain a high standard of **automated testing** (unit, integration, E2E) and use **CI/CD pipelines** to automate builds, testing, and deployments. We also foster collaboration through practices like **Pair/Mob Programming** and ensure system health with robust **monitoring and observability**.

### Specializations (https://manual.23people.io/technical-guide/software-development/)
We have specialized approaches for key areas like AI/ML and Cloud. For **AI/ML**, we follow a full lifecycle from problem identification to model deployment and monitoring using MLOps practices. For **Cloud**, we leverage a serverless-first approach using providers like Cloudflare and DigitalOcean, and managed services from AWS (e.g., S3, CloudWatch, Cognito) to simplify infrastructure, ensure scalability, and align with our sustainability goals.

## Sustainability
### Our Commitment (https://manual.23people.io/sustainability/our-commitment/)
23people is committed to reducing its carbon footprint in line with climate science and the Paris Agreement, adopting **Science Based Targets (SBTi)**. As a fully digital and remote company, our commitment applies to all operations, including digital tools, cloud infrastructure, and indirect employee emissions. We aim to be a positive force for social and environmental progress.

### Strategy (https://manual.23people.io/sustainability/our-commitment/)
Our strategy focuses on measurable reduction targets. We pledge to **reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 50% by 2030** and achieve **carbon neutrality by 2040**. Key strategies include prioritizing cloud providers that use renewable energy, promoting energy-efficient hardware, minimizing business travel in favor of virtual meetings, and measuring our carbon footprint annually to ensure transparency and progress.

### Team (https://manual.23people.io/sustainability/team/)
Sustainability is a cross-functional effort. Our sustainability team is led by the Global Operations Manager and includes representatives from People Growth and the company founders. This team is responsible for designing strategy, measuring environmental impact, and acting as an internal change agent to foster a culture of environmental responsibility throughout the organization.

### Technology Recommendations (https://manual.23people.io/sustainability/technology-recommendations/)
We provide clear guidelines for technology choices to minimize our environmental impact. This includes prioritizing **cloud services and data centers that run on clean energy**. We encourage the use of energy-efficient hardware and promote practices like recycling and extending the lifespan of electronic devices. These recommendations are essential for reducing our digital carbon footprint and aligning our daily operations with our sustainability commitments.
