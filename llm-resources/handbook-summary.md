## About Us
### Who We Are
23people is a technology services company that specializes in software development and tech talent solutions. We focus on building and scaling high-performing, cohesive agile teams to help our clients accelerate their digital transformation and achieve their business objectives. Our identity is rooted in a commitment to technical excellence, proven methodologies, and a culture of continuous improvement.

### What We Do
We provide two primary categories of services: **Software Development** and **Tech Talent Services**. Our software development offerings include modernizing legacy platforms and building custom solutions for critical business needs, as demonstrated in sectors like finance and healthcare. Our tech talent services focus on forming, scaling, and accelerating agile development teams for clients, embedding our practices and quality standards to build their long-term capabilities.

### What Sets Us Apart
Our key differentiator is our holistic approach to team building. We combine a **flexible recruitment strategy** with **structured acceleration programs** to build cohesive, high-performing teams. This methodology, centered on **agile principles** and **continuous delivery**, ensures we meet aggressive deadlines and set new standards for quality, ultimately reducing hiring risks and delivering sustainable value to our clients.

### What We Pursue
The company operates with a clear set of long-term goals and foundational principles that guide our strategic direction and daily operations. These elements ensure that our growth and client engagements are aligned with our core vision and values. The specific details of our goals are documented within the full company handbook.

## Organization
### Overview
Our organizational structure is designed for agility, clear governance, and focused execution. It is built upon three main components: **Teams**, which manage core business functions; **Tribes**, which organize large-scale project work; and **Councils**, which provide strategic oversight and governance. This model separates daily operations from long-term strategy and client-specific delivery.

### Teams
Four core functional teams drive our business operations:
- **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Manages the entire talent lifecycle, from recruitment and selection to professional development and team allocation.
- **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for business development, client relationships, and communicating our value proposition to the market.
- **Backoffice (BKO)**: Handles all administrative, financial, and operational support functions that enable the company to run smoothly.
- **Research & Development (R&D)**: Focuses on innovation, exploring new technologies, and developing internal tools and methodologies.

### Tribes
Tribes are large-scale organizational units designed to group multiple teams and individuals working towards a common, long-term goal, often related to a specific client or product line. The primary tribes are the **Iarvis Tribe** and the **Drakkar Tribe**. This structure facilitates deep collaboration and knowledge sharing within a focused domain.

### Councils
Strategic governance is managed by several councils composed of key leaders. These include the **Founders Council**, the **High Council**, and specialized bodies like the **Iarvis Council**. These groups are responsible for setting company-wide direction, making critical business decisions, and ensuring alignment with our principles.

### Workforce Structure
Our workforce framework distinguishes between formal **Positions** and functional **Roles**. Positions, such as **Operations Director**, define an individual's formal standing and reporting line within the organization. Roles, such as **Service Delivery Manager**, describe the specific responsibilities and accountabilities an individual holds within a team or project context.

## Principles
### Fundamental Principles
23people is built on a set of fundamental principles that define our core beliefs and guide our long-term vision. These principles are the foundation for our strategy, our culture, and our interactions with clients and the community. They serve as the ultimate reference for decision-making.

### Culture and People Principles
We maintain a specific set of principles dedicated to our people and culture. These guidelines shape our collaborative environment, inform our approach to professional growth, and ensure we foster a supportive, inclusive, and high-performing workplace. They define "how we behave" as a team.

### Operational Principles
Our operational principles dictate the standards for how we execute our work. They cover key areas such as project management, service delivery, and quality assurance. These principles ensure consistency, efficiency, and excellence across all client engagements and internal projects.

## Practices

We apply **agile methodologies** across all areas of our work, with a core philosophy of **managing the work, not the people**. This practice empowers teams with autonomy and accountability, fosters iterative progress, and ensures we remain adaptable to changing requirements. Our success in client projects validates this approach.

### Communication
Our communication practices are designed for clarity and efficiency in a flexible work environment. We operate with an **asynchronous-first** mindset, prioritizing written communication to ensure thoughtfulness and create a persistent record. We follow a "write, then communicate" pattern and structure our narratives for maximum clarity.

### Learning
A culture of **continuous improvement** is central to our identity. We actively encourage and support ongoing learning through professional development opportunities. Our benefits framework includes provisions for courses and international certifications, enabling our team members to stay at the forefront of the industry.

### Using AI
We strategically leverage Artificial Intelligence in our services and internal operations. This practice is driven by our **R&D team** and our technical specialization in **AI and Machine Learning**. We focus on applying AI to solve complex client problems and improve our operational efficiency.

## Community

We offer a comprehensive benefits framework designed to support the well-being and professional growth of our team members. It is organized into several categories:
- **Agreements**: Partnerships with third-party providers for services like health insurance and banking.
- **Incentives**: Perks such as birthday days off, holiday bonuses, and vacation policies.
- **Refunds**: Reimbursements for expenses related to professional development, courses, certifications, and home office improvements.
- **Trainings**: Company-sponsored learning opportunities, such as English language courses.

### Procedures
To ensure operational consistency, we maintain documented procedures for key activities. This includes standardized **administrative processes** for common requests and guidelines for effective communication and collaboration on platforms like our company's Discord server.

We regularly organize company events to foster a strong sense of community and connection among our team members. These events are a core part of our culture, providing opportunities for social interaction and team building outside of project work.
