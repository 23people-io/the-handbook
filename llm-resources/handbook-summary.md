## About Us
### Who We Are
23people is a technology services company that specializes in software development, agile team building, and platform modernization. We operate as a strategic partner to our clients, focusing on building cohesive teams and implementing proven methodologies to achieve technical excellence. Our identity is rooted in collaboration, enabling clients to build sustainable development capabilities and accelerate their digital transformation.

### What We Do
We design, build, and scale technology solutions and development teams. Our core services, demonstrated in client projects, include **agile team scaling**, where we form and integrate high-performing development teams for clients; **platform modernization**, where we update critical systems to improve performance and sustainability; and **rapid solution development**, where we create custom platforms to meet urgent business needs, such as telemedicine systems.

### What Sets Us Apart
Our key differentiator is our approach to partnership, which extends beyond traditional outsourcing. We focus on building long-term value through a **flexible recruitment strategy** and **structured acceleration programs** that reduce hiring risks for our clients. By committing to proven agile methodologies, we ensure transparency, continuous delivery, and the ability to make rapid adjustments, which builds client confidence and delivers a high standard of quality.

### What We Pursue
We pursue long-term, strategic partnerships where we can deliver tangible impact and sustainable value. Our goal is to become a strategic extension of our clients' teams, helping them solve complex challenges through technology and best practices. We measure our success by the success of our clients, such as when our scaled teams are hired directly by them, validating the quality and integration of our work.

## Organization
### Overview
Our organization is structured to foster collaboration, specialization, and effective governance. It is composed of functional **Teams**, client-focused **Tribes**, and strategic **Councils**. This matrix structure allows us to manage internal operations efficiently while delivering specialized services and strategic guidance across the company.

### Teams
The company is organized into four primary functional teams, each with a distinct purpose:
- **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Manages the entire talent lifecycle, including recruitment, professional development, and allocation of technical professionals to projects and teams.
- **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for identifying client needs, developing new business opportunities, and managing client relationships. This team drives our consultative sales process.
- **Backoffice (BKO)**: Handles all administrative, financial, and people management operations, ensuring the smooth and compliant functioning of the company.
- **Research & Development (R&D)**: Focuses on innovation, exploring emerging technologies, and developing new methodologies to keep the company at the forefront of the industry.

### Tribes
Tribes are larger, cross-functional groups that represent core service delivery units, often aligned with specific clients or long-term projects. They act as the primary structure for executing client work and building specialized knowledge domains. The two main tribes are:
- **Iarvis Tribe**
- **Drakkar Tribe**

### Councils
Councils are specialized governance bodies responsible for strategic decision-making and maintaining standards in critical areas. Their guidance ensures consistency and alignment with company principles. Key councils include:
- **High Council**
- **Iarvis Council**
- **Founders Council**

### Workforce Structure
Our workforce is defined by a dual structure of **Positions** and **Roles**. **Positions** are formal job titles that reflect an individual's level and career path within the company (e.g., Operations Director). **Roles** are functional responsibilities that describe what a person does on a specific project or team (e.g., Service Delivery Manager). This system provides both a clear organizational hierarchy and the flexibility to assign responsibilities based on project needs.

## Principles
Our operations, culture, and decision-making are guided by a well-defined set of principles organized into three distinct categories. These principles serve as the stable foundation for how we work and collaborate.
### Fundamental Principles
These are the core, unchanging beliefs that define our identity and strategic direction. They guide our most critical decisions and shape our relationship with clients and the community.

### Culture and People Principles
These principles guide our interactions, how we build our teams, and our commitment to creating a supportive and high-performing work environment. They focus on fostering growth, collaboration, and individual well-being.

### Operational Principles
These principles define how we execute our work. They ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency in our projects and internal processes, reinforcing our commitment to technical excellence and client success.

## Practices
### Agile Management
We practice **Agile Management** as a core philosophy. Our focus is on managing the work, not the people, using methodologies that promote continuous delivery, transparency, and adaptability. This approach empowers our teams and ensures our projects remain aligned with client objectives.

### Communication
Our primary communication practice is **asynchronous-first**. We prioritize writing things down clearly and structuring the narrative before communicating. This creates a persistent record of decisions, reduces interruptions, and allows for more thoughtful, inclusive collaboration across time zones.

### Learning
Continuous learning is integral to our culture. We support this through structured benefits, including reimbursements for courses and international certifications, ensuring our team members can continuously develop their skills and stay current with industry trends.

### Using AI
We strategically integrate **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to enhance our services and internal operations. The use of AI is guided by our principles and overseen by dedicated councils to ensure responsible and effective implementation.

## Community
### Benefits Framework
We offer a comprehensive benefits framework designed to support the well-being and professional growth of our team members. The framework is organized into four categories:
- **Agreements**: Partnerships with external organizations for services like banking and complementary health insurance.
- **Incentives**: Rewards and perks, such as additional vacation days, birthday gifts, and holiday bonuses.
- **Refunds**: Reimbursements for expenses that support professional development and well-being, including courses, certifications, and workspace improvements.
- **Trainings**: Company-sponsored learning opportunities, such as English language courses.

### Procedures
To ensure clarity and consistency, we maintain documented procedures for key activities. This includes formal **administrative procedures** for common requests and operations, as well as clear guidelines for communication and collaboration on platforms like our **Discord server**.

### Events
We regularly organize company **events** to foster a sense of community, strengthen relationships between team members, and celebrate our collective successes.

## Technical Guide
### Software Development Principles
Our software development is grounded in a set of core principles that emphasize **technical excellence**, maintainability, and security. These principles ensure we deliver high-quality, robust, and scalable solutions for our clients.

### Methodologies
We standardize on **Agile methodologies** for all software development projects. This iterative approach allows for flexibility, continuous feedback from stakeholders, and the consistent delivery of value throughout the project lifecycle, as proven in our client success cases.

### Technologies
We maintain expertise in a broad range of technologies, including both established **enterprise platforms** and **emerging technologies**. This flexibility allows us to choose the optimal technology stack to solve specific client challenges effectively.

### Practices
We adhere to a set of defined **software development practices** that cover the entire development lifecycle. These standardized practices ensure consistency, code quality, and collaboration across all our development teams.

### Specializations
While we are proficient in a wide range of technologies, we have developed deep expertise and specialized services in several key areas:
- **AI and Machine Learning**
- **Cloud** architecture and engineering
- **Security** best practices and implementation

## Sustainability
### Our Commitment
We are formally committed to operating as a sustainable and socially responsible organization. This commitment is a core part of our identity and influences our business strategy and daily operations.

### Strategy
We have a defined **sustainability strategy** focused on reducing our environmental impact. A key component of this strategy is the measurement and reduction of our carbon emissions.

### Team
A dedicated **Sustainability Team** is responsible for leading, implementing, and monitoring our sustainability initiatives. This team ensures that our commitment is translated into concrete actions and measurable results.

### Technology Recommendations
To support our sustainability goals, we provide **technology recommendations** for both internal use and client projects. These guidelines promote the use of energy-efficient hardware, green cloud services, and sustainable software architecture patterns.
