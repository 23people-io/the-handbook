## Organization
### Overview
23people is structured around a network of specialized **Teams**, cross-functional **Tribes**, and governing **Councils**. This model is designed to promote agility, clear ownership, and effective collaboration. Teams are the primary operational units, Tribes group individuals for client-facing projects, and Councils provide strategic oversight and governance.

### Teams
Teams are functional units responsible for specific business domains.

- **Tech Talent Services (TTS):** This team is responsible for talent acquisition, management, and allocation. It focuses on optimizing recruitment processes, managing professional development, and ensuring our technical teams are staffed effectively. TTS tracks key performance indicators related to talent forecasting and acquisition.
- **Sales & Marketing (SMKT):** This team drives business growth by managing client relationships, prospecting new opportunities, and communicating our value proposition. They follow structured workflows for prospecting and consultative sales and manage key KPI areas for client relationship health.
- **Backoffice (BKO):** The BKO team provides essential support services that enable the organization to operate smoothly. It is organized into three main service categories: **People Management**, **Financial Management**, and **Services Management**. The People Management function, in particular, uses a data-driven approach, tracking a range of KPIs related to workforce stability, such as professional turnover, retention rates, tenure, and engagement, without focusing on specific values.
- **Research & Development (R&D):** This team focuses on innovation, exploring new technologies, and developing internal tools and frameworks. They are responsible for keeping 23people at the forefront of technological advancements and ensuring our practices remain modern and effective.

### Tribes
Tribes are cross-functional groups of professionals organized to deliver value to specific clients or projects. They are the primary structure for service delivery.

- **Iarvis Tribe:** A dedicated, cross-functional team focused on delivering specific client projects or services.
- **Drakkar Tribe:** Another dedicated, cross-functional team structured to serve distinct client needs or technological domains.

### Councils
Councils are governance bodies that provide strategic direction and make key decisions.

- **Founders Council:** Provides foundational vision and long-term strategic guidance for the company.
- **High Council:** The primary governing body responsible for major operational and strategic decisions.
- **Iarvis Council:** A specialized council likely overseeing the governance and direction of the Iarvis Tribe's initiatives.

### Workforce Structure
The workforce is organized through a system of formal **positions** and **roles**. **Positions** define an individual's formal standing and career path within the company (e.g., Operations Director). **Roles** define a person's responsibilities and functions within a specific context or team (e.g., Service Delivery Manager), allowing for flexible and clear accountability.

## Principles
Our actions and decisions are guided by a clear set of principles organized into three distinct categories.

### Fundamental Principles
These are the core, unshakeable beliefs that define our identity and approach to business. They serve as the foundation for all other principles and guide our long-term strategy and ethical conduct.

## Practices

### Communication
Our communication practices are designed for clarity and efficiency in a distributed environment. We prioritize **asynchronous communication** to respect focus time and employ a **"write, then communicate"** approach to ensure ideas are well-formed. We also structure the narrative of our work to provide clear context and updates.

### Learning
Continuous learning is integral to our culture. We provide frameworks and resources for personal and professional development, encouraging team members to acquire new skills, stay current with industry trends, and share knowledge across the organization.

### Using AI
We leverage Artificial Intelligence to enhance our operations, services, and decision-making processes. Our use of AI is governed by internal guidelines that ensure ethical, responsible, and effective implementation of AI technologies to drive innovation and efficiency.

## Community
### Benefits Framework
We offer a comprehensive benefits package designed to support the well-being and growth of our professionals. The framework is structured into several categories:
- **Agreements:** Partnerships with external providers for services like wellness platforms (Betterfly) and banking.
- **Incentives:** Perks and bonuses such as vacation days, birthday gifts, and holiday allowances.
- **Refunds:** Reimbursements for expenses that support professional and personal well-being, including certifications, courses, and workspace improvements.
- **Trainings:** Company-sponsored learning opportunities, such as English language courses, to foster skill development.

### Procedures
