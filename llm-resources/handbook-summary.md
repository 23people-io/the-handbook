# 23people Company Handbook Summary

## Executive Overview

23people is a Chilean technology company founded in 2014 by Software Engineers and Computer Scientists Marcelo Ampuero and Manuel Reyes, who continue to lead the company as Engineering Director and General Director respectively. Based in Santiago, Chile, the company operates as a trusted technological facilitator and co-creator for businesses seeking to evolve their digital products and services across three continents—Latin America, North America, and Europe.

With nearly 90 active professionals primarily in technical roles, 23people has established itself as more than a traditional staff augmentation firm. The company's foundation rests on the dream of creating "the company where we would have loved to work"—a human-centered organization where respect holds more value than imposition, and knowledge stands above hierarchy. Throughout its decade of existence, over 500 professionals have been part of 23people's journey, maintaining an impressive average tenure of approximately 16 months and supporting nearly 100 projects for more than 10 major enterprise clients.

The company's name itself carries deep significance, representing not just a number but a commitment to being more than mere resources—they are 23 people, each with their own story, expertise, and contribution to make.

## Core Business and Services

23people specializes in three complementary service lines designed to address the skilled talent, technology utilization, and data challenges that companies face in their Digital Evolution journey:

### 1. IT Talent Outsourcing and Recruitment

The company excels at finding, selecting, and retaining Tech Professionals who are genuinely passionate about technology. Unlike traditional recruiters who merely review CVs and forward candidates, 23people validates technical skills and real project experience. They offer two primary models:

- **IT Outsourcing**: Professionals work on client projects while employed under 23people's legal structure
- **IT Hunting**: Direct assistance in searching and selecting IT professionals for clients' direct hiring needs

### 2. Digital Platforms, Cloud, and Modernization

23people co-creates solutions for continuous improvement areas including Digitalization, Automation, Integrations, and Operational Data. Leveraging Cloud technologies, DevOps practices, QA Automation, Cybersecurity measures, and Agile methodologies, they help modernize and evolve digital platforms to be effective, secure, and efficient. Their experience spans large-scale technological projects used by hundreds of companies and thousands of users worldwide.

### 3. Data, Advanced Analytics, and AI

The company enables data-driven decision-making that contributes to real operational and strategic improvements. They help organizations leverage their data potential through advanced analytics and artificial intelligence implementations, transforming raw information into actionable business insights.

## Organizational Structure

23people operates through a circular organizational structure designed to foster collaboration and communication across teams and organizational layers. The company is organized into multidisciplinary teams, each with a clear purpose and responsibility for delivering services to internal teams or external clients.

### Operational Teams

All operational teams are grouped under the **Iarvis Tribe**, which includes:

- **Tech Talent Services Team (TTS)**: Provides the best experience in selecting, validating, and retaining Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and best match client projects

### Leadership and Governance

The operational teams are led by a Global Operations Manager, with each team having a Service Request Manager (SRM) who manages the "what and when" of requests, and a Service Delivery Manager (SDM) who defines "how and who" executes each service. Strategic alignment is ensured through the High Council, which defines and communicates organizational strategy.

### Autonomy and Service Contracts

Each team operates autonomously around its well-defined purpose, delivering services through clear service contracts (similar to APIs). The organization emphasizes continuous measurement of service quality and operational efficiency, with iterative improvements based on data and accumulated experience.

## Company Culture and Principles
