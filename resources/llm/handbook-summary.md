## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized into **multidisciplinary teams** with a circular structure to foster collaboration. Our core operational model is inspired by software **APIs**, where each team provides services with a well-defined contract specifying what it delivers, what to expect, and how to request its services. This model grants teams autonomy to achieve their purpose while aligning with the company's strategic goals. Teams are expected to continuously measure and improve their service quality and operational efficiency based on data and experience.

### Teams (docs/organization/teams/index.md)

Our operational teams are grouped under the Iarvis Tribe and are led by a **Global Operations Manager**. Each team has a **Service Request Manager (SRM)** managing the "what" and "when" of requests, and a **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)** managing the "how" and "who."

-   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of tech professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best fit for our clients' projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
-   **Backoffice (BKO)**: Provides agile and efficient administrative support in Company Management, Accounting & Tax, and People Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
-   **Research & Development (R&D)**: Drives the digital evolution of our clients by exploring and mastering emerging technologies to generate tangible business value.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

Teams are grouped into two tribes that share common purposes:

-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all internal operational teams of 23people (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D), focused on supporting the company's structure and growth.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Consists of all professionals and teams working on a subcontracting basis for our clients, delivering services directly within their projects.

### Councils

While not fully detailed, the organizational structure includes councils for strategic alignment. The **High Council** is a strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy, ensuring all operational teams are aligned with it.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/workforce/positions/index.md)

Our structure distinguishes between **Positions (Cargos)** and **Roles**:

-   A **Position** is a formal, more permanent title in the organizational structure that defines a professional's fundamental competencies and career path. A single position can hold multiple roles.
-   A **Role** is a flexible, dynamic assignment defining specific responsibilities and functions within a team or project. It's how a position's competencies are applied in a specific context. Key roles include the **Service Request Manager (SRM)** and **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**.

Seniority levels are based on skill development and learnings, not years of experience:

-   **Entry**: Professionals starting their careers who require guidance.
-   **Intermediate**: Professionals with proven experience who serve as a reference for others.
-   **Senior**: Professionals with deep expertise who act as undisputed references and can take on leadership roles like Tech Lead or Architect.

## Principles

### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)

-   **Agility**: We embrace agile values to adapt quickly, improve continuously, and respond to change effectively, prioritizing individuals, working software, collaboration, and responsiveness.
-   **Transparency**: We make information public by default, with exceptions for sensitive client, employee, or provider data. We believe transparency fosters productivity, trust, and collaboration.
-   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources, privileging remote work and digital processes to reduce our environmental impact.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/index.md)

We follow the principle of **managing the work, not the people**. We use a **Kanban-based methodology** to visualize workflows, limit work-in-progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. Our boards are typically divided into five areas: **Backlog**, **Requested**, **In Progress**, **Done**, and **Ready to Archive**. Daily meetings follow a structured algorithm, focusing on completing work before starting new items. We also use **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** for strategic alignment.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

Our communication practices are designed for clarity and efficiency in a remote-first environment.

-   We prefer **asynchronous communication** to allow team members to manage their time effectively and provide thoughtful responses.
-   We encourage **writing down ideas before sharing them** to ensure clarity and create a documented record.
-   We use a **structured narrative** (Context, Question, Answer) when presenting initiatives or problems to ensure clear and effective communication.
-   We promptly **acknowledge receipt of messages** to reduce uncertainty and anxiety for the sender.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We foster a culture of continuous learning. A key technique we promote involves a five-step process for deep understanding:
1.  Select and study a topic.
2.  Explain it as if teaching someone else.
3.  Return to studying when encountering difficulties.
4.  Simplify the language and use analogies.
5.  Review the explanation for clarity, repeating the process if it's still confusing.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/index.md)

We leverage AI as a **professional capabilities multiplier**. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to create dedicated workspaces with pre-defined instructions for recurring tasks. This helps us automate repetitive work, maintain quality standards, and free up our professionals to focus on high-impact activities. Generated content is always treated as a draft that requires professional review and refinement.

## Community
