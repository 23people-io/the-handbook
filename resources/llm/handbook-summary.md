## Organization
### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)
23people is organized in a circular structure to foster collaboration and communication between teams and organizational layers. The structure is built around multidisciplinary operational teams, each with a clear, well-defined purpose and autonomy to achieve it. These teams deliver services to internal teams or external clients through service contracts, similar to APIs. Each team is expected to measure and iteratively improve its service quality and operational efficiency based on data.

### Teams (docs/organization/teams/index.md)
Our operational teams are the core of our service delivery:
*   **Tech Talent Services Team (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
*   **Sales & Marketing Team (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing relationships with current ones, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
*   **Backoffice Team (BKO)**: Provides the best administrative support, enabling other teams to succeed by managing people operations, finances, and company administration efficiently.
*   **Research & Development Team (R&D)**: Drives our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real business value.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)
Teams are grouped into two **Tribes** that share common objectives:
*   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D) that work to support the company's strategic goals and core functions.
*   **Drakkar Tribe**: Consists of all tech professionals and teams working on a subcontract basis for our clients, forming the core of our IT talent outsourcing service.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)
To ensure strategic alignment and governance, we have specific councils:
*   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy, ensuring that all operational teams are aligned with it.
*   **Iarvis Council**: Responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)
We distinguish between **Positions** (Cargos) and **Roles**.
*   A **Position** defines a professional's level and core competencies within the organization's hierarchy (e.g., Senior Software Engineer).
*   A **Role** defines a specific set of responsibilities a person takes on in a particular context, team, or project (e.g., Tech Lead).

This flexible structure allows a professional in one position to perform multiple roles across different teams. For example, a Senior Software Engineer from the R&D team could act as a Technical Interviewer for the TTS team. This promotes internal mobility, skill utilization, and professional development.

## Principles
### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)
*   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are lifelong learners who pursue excellence in everything we do. We embrace a mindset of continuous improvement with genuine curiosity, seeking technical and professional mastery through iterative, data-driven work.
*   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We genuinely support and collaborate with one another through honest transparency and assertive communication. We work as a team, sharing responsibilities, celebrating victories, and supporting each other through challenges. We prioritize open communication channels to build trust and improve productivity.
*   **Sustainable Growth and Being a Reference**: We are ambitious about growing economically and becoming international benchmarks, but we do so at a systematic and sustainable pace. We do not sacrifice the well-being of our team, our clients, or our planet for short-term gains.

### Culture and People Principles (docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)
*   **People First**: We work to live, not live to work. We strive to create an environment where people are at the center, fostering a culture of respect, empathy, and mutual benefit. We believe in leaders, not bosses, and prioritize the well-being and personal success of our team members and clients.
*   **Equity**: We believe in a humane and motivating company where everyone is treated with respect and equality. We avoid all forms of discrimination in our selection processes, as talent is uniformly distributed in society. We apply positive discrimination only as a tie-breaker between equally qualified candidates to support underrepresented groups.
*   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction. Whether with clients, tech professionals, administrative staff, or suppliers, we aim for exceptional quality that builds lasting, positive relationships.

### Operational Principles (docs/principles/operationals/index.md)

*   **Transparency**: We are committed to making our practices and processes accessible and verifiable. Information is public by default, with exceptions for confidential client, employee, or supplier data. We believe the benefits of trust and productivity outweigh the costs.
*   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We are a 100% digital and cloud-based company, privileging remote work and technologies that reduce our environmental impact.

## Practices
### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)
We manage **work, not people**, using **Kanban** as our core agile methodology. This practice allows us to visualize workflows, limit work-in-progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. We use visual boards to track the status of all work items, from service requests to strategic initiatives. This approach fosters a collaborative environment focused on continuous flow and improvement, rather than micromanagement. Daily meetings are structured to review the board from right to left (closer to "Done"), ensuring the team focuses on finishing tasks before starting new ones.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)
Our communication practices are designed for clarity, efficiency, and collaboration in a remote-first environment.
*   We prefer **asynchronous communication** to allow team members to manage their time effectively and provide thoughtful responses.
*   We encourage **writing ideas down before sharing them** to ensure clarity and create a durable record of decisions.
*   We use a **structured narrative framework (Context-Response)** for presenting initiatives and problems, ensuring all stakeholders have a clear and complete understanding.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)
We follow a structured technique for effective learning, inspired by the Feynman method. This involves selecting a topic, explaining it in simple terms as if teaching someone else, identifying knowledge gaps when we get stuck, studying to fill those gaps, and then simplifying the explanation further. This process ensures a deep and lasting understanding of new concepts.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)
We view AI as a **professional capabilities multiplier**. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and generate initial drafts for documents, allowing our team to focus on higher-value activities. All AI-generated content is treated as a starting point that requires professional review, editing, and contextualization. We maintain strict security and confidentiality protocols, ensuring no sensitive data is used with these tools.

## Community
### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)
We offer a range of benefits aimed at supporting the physical, mental, and professional well-being of our team. Eligibility for most benefits begins after a three-month ramp-up period.
*   **Agreements**: We have partnerships that provide benefits like the **Betterfly** wellness app, preferential terms with **Banco de Chile**, and comprehensive **complementary health, dental, life, and catastrophic insurance**. The company covers 100% of the employee's insurance cost.
*   **Incentives**: We provide an **economic incentive for taking vacations** (minimum 5 business days), birthday gifts and a day off, and bonuses for national holidays and Christmas. A **Baby Shower bonus** is available for employees with at least one year of tenure.
*   **Reimbursements**: We offer reimbursements for the **annual flu vaccine**, approved professional development **courses**, international **certifications**, and items to **improve the home office workspace** (e.g., ergonomic chair, monitor).
*   **Training**: We regularly offer group **English classes** to help our team improve their language skills.

### Procedures (community/procedures/administratives.md)
We maintain clear and documented procedures for administrative tasks such as expense reporting and fund rendering. We also provide a guide for onboarding new members to our company's Discord server to ensure a smooth integration into our communication channels.

### Events (docs/community/events/index.md)
We organize various company events to foster community and collaboration. Photos and videos from these events are stored in a shared Google Drive accessible to the team.
