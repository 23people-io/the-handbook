## Practices
### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)
We **manage the work, not the people**, using **Kanban** principles to visualize workflow, limit work in progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. Our process focuses on moving tasks through a visual board with clear stages (Backlog, Requested, In Progress, Done), which helps identify bottlenecks and fosters a culture of finishing work before starting new tasks. This approach promotes autonomy, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)
We prioritize **asynchronous communication** to allow for focused work and respect for different schedules. We encourage team members to **write down their ideas before sharing them** to promote clarity and thoughtfulness. When presenting initiatives or problems, we use a **structured narrative** (Context, Complication, Question, Answer) to ensure the message is clear, logical, and effective.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)
We promote a technique for effective learning that involves **explaining a new concept as if teaching it to someone else**. This process helps identify knowledge gaps and solidifies understanding. The cycle involves studying a topic, explaining it in simple terms, identifying areas of difficulty, re-studying those areas, and simplifying the explanation until it is clear and concise.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)
We leverage AI as a **professional capability multiplier**. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to create dedicated workspaces with pre-defined instructions and context. This allows our teams to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and generate structured drafts for documents, freeing them to focus on higher-impact activities. AI-generated content always serves as a starting point that requires professional review and refinement.

## Community
### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)
We offer a comprehensive benefits program to support our team's physical, mental, and professional well-being. The framework is designed to be accessible to all team members with at least three months of tenure. Key benefit categories include:
*   **Agreements**: Partnerships that provide access to services like the **Betterfly** wellness app, preferential plans with **Banco de Chile**, and **complementary health, dental, life, and catastrophic insurance**.
*   **Incentives**: Bonuses to encourage rest and celebrate milestones, including an **economic incentive for taking vacations**, a **birthday gift and day off**, bonuses for **national holidays and Christmas**, and a **baby shower bonus** for new parents.
*   **Reimbursements**: Financial support for professional and personal well-being, such as for the annual **influenza vaccine**, professional development **courses**, **international certification exams**, and improvements to the **home office workspace**.
*   **Trainings**: Company-sponsored learning opportunities, such as group **English classes**.

### Procedures (docs/community/procedures/administratives.md)
We have established procedures for common administrative tasks to ensure efficiency and clarity. These include processes for submitting **expense reports (Rendición de Fondos)** and requesting **reimbursements (Reembolso de Gastos)**.

### Events (docs/community/events/index.md)
We capture moments from company events to strengthen our community. Official photos and videos are stored in a restricted Google Shared Drive, accessible to the Marketing and People Growth teams.
