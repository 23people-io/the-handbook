## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized in a **circular structure** to foster collaboration and communication between teams and organizational layers. Our operational model is built on teams with clear purposes, autonomy, and well-defined service contracts (APIs) that specify their deliverables. Every team is expected to operate with a clear purpose, act autonomously within that purpose, fulfill its commitments via service contracts, and improve iteratively based on data.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)

Our operational teams are grouped within the Iarvis Tribe and are responsible for delivering services to internal teams or external clients.

-   **Tech Talent Services Team (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and a strong match for our clients' projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing Team (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand, presence, and market share.
-   **Backoffice Team (BKO)**: Provides the best administrative support to enable our teams to focus on their core competencies, ensuring agile, efficient, and reliable back-office management. Its services cover Company, Accounting & Tax, and People Management.
-   **Research & Development Team (R&D)**: Powers our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real value in their operations.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

We group teams with shared objectives into **Tribes** to foster common identity and purpose.

-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to drive the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with our strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all teams and professionals working on subcontracting assignments for our clients, either as dedicated teams or as individual contributors.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

Councils are strategic and coordinating bodies within our organization.

-   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy and ensuring that operational teams are aligned with it.
-   **Iarvis Council**: Defined by the Global Operations Manager, this council is responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)

Our workforce is structured around **Positions (Cargos)** and **Roles**. A **Position** defines a professional's level and capabilities within the organization, while a **Role** defines their specific responsibilities and actions within a particular team or project. This flexible structure allows a professional to hold one position (e.g., Senior Software Engineer) while performing different roles (e.g., Tech Lead, Technical Interviewer) across various teams.

We define three main seniority levels based on skill development and learning, not years of experience:

-   **Entry**: A professional starting their career who requires guidance.
-   **Intermediate**: A professional with proven experience who serves as a reference for others.
-   **Senior**: A professional with deep expertise who acts as an undisputed reference and leader.

## Principles

### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)

9.  **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We are a 100% digital and remote-first company, which allows us to optimize resources and reduce our environmental impact.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

We **manage the work, not the people**, using **Kanban** as our core agile methodology. Our approach focuses on visualizing workflows, limiting work in progress (WIP) to maximize efficiency, and fostering continuous improvement. Work items move through a visual board with standardized areas: **Backlog** (unrefined ideas), **Requested** (committed work), **In Progress** (active work), **Done** (completed), and **Archive**. This system provides clarity, improves flow, and empowers teams to self-organize around delivering value.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

Effective communication is key to our success. We prioritize:

-   **Asynchronous Communication**: To allow collaborators to manage their time efficiently and provide thoughtful responses.
-   **Writing Before Sharing**: We encourage writing down ideas to clarify them before communicating them to others, which improves clarity and decision-making.
-   **Structured Narratives**: We use frameworks like SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) to present initiatives and problems clearly and effectively.
-   **Prompt Acknowledgment**: We acknowledge receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce uncertainty and anxiety for the sender.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We follow a technique for effective learning that involves selecting a topic, explaining it as if teaching someone else, identifying and filling knowledge gaps, and simplifying the language until the concept is deeply understood. This method ensures robust comprehension and long-term retention of knowledge.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

We use AI, specifically tools like **Claude Projects**, as a **capability multiplier** for our internal teams. This approach allows us to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our professionals to focus on higher-value activities. AI-generated content is always treated as a **first draft** that requires professional review, editing, and contextualization by our team members to ensure accuracy and alignment with our standards.

## Community

### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)

We offer a range of benefits designed to support our team's physical, mental, and professional well-being. Eligibility for most benefits begins after three months of tenure. The framework includes:

-   **Agreements**: Partnerships with providers like **Betterfly** (wellness app and life insurance), **Banco de Chile** (banking benefits), and **Zurich** (complementary health, dental, catastrophic, and life insurance).
-   **Incentives**: Financial bonuses for taking **vacations**, gifts for **birthdays**, and bonuses for national holidays (**Fiestas Patrias and Christmas**).
-   **Refunds**: Reimbursement programs for obtaining **international certifications**, taking professional development **courses**, improving the **home office workspace**, and receiving the annual **influenza vaccine**.
-   **Trainings**: Company-sponsored training programs, such as **English classes**.

### Procedures (docs/community/procedures/administratives.md)

We maintain clear and documented administrative procedures for processes such as fund reporting and expense reimbursement to ensure consistency and transparency. We also have guidelines for managing access and roles on our internal communication platforms like Discord.

### Events (docs/community/events/index.md)

We capture memories from our company events and gatherings. Photographs and videos from these events are stored in a shared, access-controlled drive to preserve our community's history.

## Technical Guide

### Software Development Principles (docs/technical-guide/software-development/principles.md)

Our development philosophy is centered on **simplifying real-world problems**. This is guided by several core principles:
