## About Us

### Who We Are (docs/about-us/who-we-are/index.md)

**23people is a technology company composed of professionals passionate about creating a sustainable business model and an ideal work environment.** Founded on November 26, 2014, in Santiago, Chile, by software engineers **Marcelo Ampuero** (Engineering Director) and **Manuel Reyes** (General Director), the company was born from the vision of "creating a company where we would have liked to work." This translates into a culture that prioritizes people—clients and professionals alike—and seeks shared benefit and a positive societal impact.

The company's name, "23people," is inspired by the movie *The Matrix Reloaded*, referencing the 23 individuals selected to rebuild Zion, symbolizing the spirit of rebuilding and innovation.

## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized in a **circular structure** of multidisciplinary teams to foster collaboration and communication. Each team operates with a clear, defined purpose and a degree of autonomy, delivering services to other internal teams or external clients through service contracts, similar to an **API**.

This model emphasizes improving services iteratively based on data and experience. We distinguish between **Positions (Cargos)**, which define a professional's level and capabilities within the organization, and **Roles**, which are specific sets of responsibilities assumed within a team or project. This allows for flexibility and mobility, as a professional with a single Position can perform different Roles across various teams.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)

Our operational teams are the core of our service delivery, each with a distinct purpose:

*   **Tech Talent Services Team (TTS)**: Provides the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
*   **Sales & Marketing Team (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing relationships with current ones, and growing the 23people brand, presence, and market share.
*   **Backoffice Team (BKO)**: Delivers agile and efficient administrative support in Company Management, Accounting & Tax, and People Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
*   **Research & Development Team (R&D)**: Drives the digital evolution of our clients by exploring and mastering emerging technologies to generate real value in their operations.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

We use the concept of **Tribes** to group teams with shared, high-level objectives:

*   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to drive the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with the company's strategic goals.
*   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all professionals and teams working on-site or remotely for clients in an outsourcing model. Its purpose is to ensure we have the right talent to meet client needs effectively.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

Councils are strategic groups that guide the organization:

*   **High Council**: The strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's overall strategy, ensuring that all operational teams are aligned with it.
*   **Iarvis Council**: A body responsible for the coordination and alignment of the Iarvis Tribe's operational teams, supporting the Global Operations Manager in implementing strategic initiatives.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)

Our workforce is structured around two key concepts:

*   **Positions (Cargos)**: Define a professional's hierarchical level, expected capabilities, and career progression within 23people. A higher level implies greater strategic autonomy and responsibility. Positions are consistent across the organization.
*   **Roles**: Represent a specific set of responsibilities and functions that a professional undertakes within a particular team or project. A single person can hold multiple roles, and roles are dynamic. Key operational roles include:
    *   **Service Request Manager (SRM)**: The interface with the client, responsible for managing the "what" and "when" of service requests.
    *   **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**: Manages the internal team's workflow, responsible for the "how" and "who" of service delivery.

## Principles

### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)

These principles define our core identity and guide our actions.

*   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are lifelong learners who pursue excellence in our work. We embrace an iterative, data-driven approach to consolidate what we learn and teach others.
*   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We genuinely support each other with honesty and transparency. We work as a team, sharing responsibilities and celebrating successes together. We prioritize clear communication to build trust and improve productivity.
*   **Sustainable Growth and Leadership**: We are ambitious about economic growth and becoming international benchmarks, but we achieve this at a sustainable pace that respects our people, clients, and the planet.

### Culture and People Principles (docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)

These principles shape our interactions and work environment.

*   **People First**: We work to live, not the other way around. We believe that a motivated person is more effective than a stressed one. We prioritize the well-being and personal success of our clients and collaborators.
*   **Equity**: We treat everyone with respect and equality. We avoid discrimination in our selection processes, as we believe talent is distributed uniformly. We apply positive discrimination only as a tie-breaker between equally qualified candidates to support underrepresented groups.
*   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction—with clients, professionals, administrative staff, and suppliers—to build lasting relationships.

### Operational Principles (docs/principles/operationals/index.md)

These principles guide our daily work and organizational processes.

*   **Agility**: We adhere to agile values to adapt quickly, foster continuous improvement, minimize waste, and maintain resilience. This means prioritizing individuals, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
*   **Transparency**: We make information and processes public whenever possible, excluding sensitive client, employee, or supplier data. We believe the benefits of trust and productivity outweigh the risks.
*   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We prioritize remote work, digitalization, and technologies that reduce our environmental impact.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

**We manage the work, not the people.** We use visual and systematic workflows, primarily based on **Kanban**, to provide a clear view of all activities. This approach fosters a collaborative environment focused on continuous improvement. Key elements include:

*   **Visual Workflows**: Using Kanban boards to track tasks through stages like Backlog, Requested, In Progress, and Done.
*   **WIP (Work in Progress) Limits**: Limiting concurrent tasks to prevent overload and encourage finishing work before starting new items.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: Using daily meetings to review progress, identify blockers, and optimize the workflow. We also use **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** to align team efforts with strategic goals.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

We follow practices that promote effective and collaborative communication:

*   **Prefer Asynchronous Communication**: This allows team members to manage their time and energy efficiently, reduces interruptions, and fosters more thoughtful responses.
*   **Write Ideas Before Sharing**: We encourage writing down ideas to clarify them before communicating them to others, which improves clarity and decision-making.
*   **Structure Narratives**: When presenting initiatives or problems, we use a structured narrative (**Context, Question, Answer**) to ensure clear and effective communication.
*   **Acknowledge Messages Promptly**: We confirm receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce uncertainty and anxiety for the sender.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We promote a technique for effective learning that involves:

1.  **Select and study** a topic.
2.  **Explain it** as if teaching someone else to identify knowledge gaps.
3.  **Return to studying** to fill those gaps.
4.  **Simplify the language** and use analogies to deepen understanding.
This method ensures profound comprehension and long-term retention.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

**We view AI as a multiplier of professional capabilities.** We use tools like **Claude Projects** to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our teams to focus on high-value activities. These projects use pre-defined instructions and context to generate drafts for tasks like creating Kanban card descriptions or documenting processes. All AI-generated content is treated as a starting point that requires professional review, editing, and validation by our teams.

## Community

### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)

We offer a range of benefits to support our team's physical, mental, and professional well-being. Most benefits are available to all team members with at least three months of tenure. The framework is categorized as follows:

*   **Agreements**: Partnerships that provide access to services like the **Betterfly** wellness app, preferential plans with **Banco de Chile**, and complementary **health, dental, catastrophic, and life insurance**.
*   **Incentives**: Financial bonuses and perks, including an **incentive for taking vacations** (for blocks of 5, 10, or 15 days), a **birthday gift and day off**, bonuses for **national holidays and Christmas**, and a **Baby Shower bonus**.
*   **Refunds**: Reimbursement programs for expenses related to professional development and well-being, such as **international certification exams**, online **courses**, improvements to the **home office workspace**, and the annual **influenza vaccination**.
*   **Trainings**: Company-sponsored learning opportunities, such as group **English classes**.

### Procedures (docs/community/procedures/administratives.md)

We maintain documented procedures for key administrative tasks to ensure consistency and efficiency. This includes processes for expense reports and fund disbursements. We also have a guide for incorporating new members into our company's Discord server.

### Events (docs/community/events/index.md)
