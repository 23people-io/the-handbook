## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized in a **circular structure of multidisciplinary teams** to foster collaboration and communication. Each team has a clear purpose and operates with autonomy, delivering services to other internal teams or external clients through well-defined **service contracts (similar to APIs)**. Teams are expected to continuously measure the quality and efficiency of their services and improve iteratively based on data and experience.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)

We have four core operational teams:
-   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in recruiting, validating, and retaining Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
-   **Backoffice (BKO)**: Provides agile, efficient, and reliable administrative support (People Management, Financial Management, Services Management) to enable other teams to focus on their core functions.
-   **Research & Development (R&D)**: Enhances clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies to generate real value.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

Teams are grouped into two **Tribes** that share common objectives:
-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D) and is focused on delivering high-quality, sustainable services aligned with strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Consists of all professionals and teams working in subcontracting mode for our clients, ensuring we have the right talent to meet their needs.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

Strategic and operational alignment is managed through councils:
-   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy and ensuring operational teams are aligned with it.
-   **Iarvis Council**: Responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)

Our structure is based on two complementary concepts:
-   **Positions (Cargos)**: Define a professional's level, capabilities, and expected contribution within the organization (e.g., Intermediate Tech Relations Specialist, Senior Operations Director). Higher levels imply greater strategic autonomy and impact.
-   **Roles**: Define specific, dynamic responsibilities a professional assumes in a particular context, team, or project (e.g., Service Request Manager, Service Delivery Manager). A person in one position can perform multiple roles across different teams. Key roles include the **Global Operations Manager**, who orchestrates the Iarvis Tribe, and the **Service Request Manager (SRM)** and **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**, who manage the "what/when" and "how/who" of service delivery, respectively.

## Principles

### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)

-   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are lifelong learners who pursue excellence in everything we do, constantly improving our skills with genuine curiosity.
-   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We support each other with honest transparency and co-create solutions as a team, prioritizing clear communication.
-   **Sustainable Growth and Being Referents**: We are ambitious about growing and becoming international benchmarks, but at a sustainable pace that respects our people and the planet.

### Culture and People Principles (docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)

-   **People First**: We work to live, not live to work. We prioritize the well-being and professional growth of our team and clients, fostering an environment of respect, empathy, and collaboration.
-   **Equity**: We believe in treating everyone respectfully and equally, avoiding all forms of discrimination in our selection and work processes.
-   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction, whether with clients, tech professionals, internal staff, or suppliers.

### Operational Principles (docs/principles/operationals/index.md)

-   **Agility**: We embrace agile values to adapt quickly, foster continuous improvement, collaborate effectively, and remain resilient.
-   **Transparency**: We make information public by default, excluding sensitive client, employee, or supplier data, to enhance productivity and trust.
-   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision, making responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We are a 100% digital and remote company.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

**We manage the work, not the people.** We use **Kanban** principles to visualize workflows, limit work-in-progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. Our Kanban boards are typically structured with five sequential areas: **Backlog** (gray), **Requested** (blue), **In Progress** (orange), **Done** (green), and **Ready to Archive** (purple). This visual system fosters collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement by focusing on the flow of value delivery. We also use **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** to align our work with strategic goals.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

We prioritize effective and collaborative communication through several key practices:
-   **Prefer Asynchronous Communication**: To allow team members to manage their time and energy efficiently and to provide a record of conversations.
-   **Write, Then Communicate**: We encourage writing down ideas before sharing them to foster clarity and well-thought-out responses.
-   **Acknowledge Messages Promptly**: We confirm receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce uncertainty and anxiety.
-   **Structure the Narrative**: We use a consistent structure (**Context, Response**) for presenting initiatives and problems to ensure clarity and effectiveness.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We follow a technique for effective learning that involves selecting a topic, explaining it as if teaching someone else, identifying and filling knowledge gaps by returning to the material, and simplifying the language until the concept is thoroughly understood and can be explained clearly.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

We use AI, specifically **Claude Projects**, as a **capability multiplier** to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our professionals for higher-value activities. The core principle is that AI-generated content serves as a **first draft** that must be reviewed, edited, and contextualized by a human professional. This practice enhances productivity while ensuring our professional judgment remains central to the final output.

## Community

### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)

We offer a range of benefits to all team members with at least three months of tenure, aimed at promoting physical, mental, and professional well-being. The framework is categorized as follows:
-   **Agreements**: Partnerships that provide access to services like **Betterfly** (wellness app and life insurance), a company plan with **Banco de Chile**, and **complementary health, dental, life, and catastrophic insurance**.
-   **Incentives**: Financial bonuses and perks, including a **vacation bonus** for taking full weeks off, a **birthday gift and day off**, bonuses for **national holidays and Christmas**, and a **baby shower bonus**.
-   **Refunds**: Reimbursement programs for expenses such as the **annual influenza vaccine**, professional development **courses** and **international certifications**, and improvements to the **home office workspace**.
-   **Trainings**: Company-sponsored learning opportunities, such as **English classes**.

### Procedures (community/procedures/administratives.md)

We maintain documented procedures for administrative tasks like expense reimbursement. We also have a clear guide for onboarding new members to our company's **Discord server**, our primary communication platform.

### Events (community/events/index.md)

We cherish our community events. All photographs and videos from these gatherings are stored in a shared Google Drive, accessible to the team, to preserve our shared memories.

## Technical Guide

### Software Development Principles (docs/technical-guide/software-development/principles.md)

Our development process is guided by the core idea of **simplifying real-world problems**. This is supported by several key principles:
-   **Simplicity Above All**: We strive to make every part of a system as simple as possible, eliminating unnecessary complexity.
-   **Balance of OOP and Functional Programming**: We apply core OOP concepts (encapsulation, abstraction) and functional principles (pure functions, immutability) to create modular, readable, and testable code.
-   **SOLID Principles**: We adhere to the five SOLID principles to build flexible, maintainable, and scalable software.
-   **Business-Centric Focus**: We seek to deeply understand the business problem before writing code to ensure we deliver true value.

### Methodologies (docs/technical-guide/software-development/methodologies.md)

We use an agile approach based on the **Kanban method**. This allows us to visualize our workflow, limit work in progress (WIP) to prevent overload, and focus on continuous improvement. Its flexibility allows us to adapt to project needs and integrate other techniques (like sprints) when necessary, while maintaining a focus on a continuous flow of value delivery.

### Technologies (docs/technical-guide/software-development/technologies.md)

Our primary technology stack is chosen for its mature ecosystem, scalability, and flexibility:
-   **Backend**: **Node.js** with the **NestJS** framework for scalable and modular applications.

We ensure quality and consistency through standardized practices:
-   **Version Control**: We use **Git** with structured workflows (e.g., GitFlow).
-   **Code Reviews**: All code changes are reviewed by peers to share knowledge and improve quality.
-   **Automated Testing**: We maintain adequate test coverage at unit, integration, and end-to-end levels.
-   **CI/CD**: We use continuous integration and delivery pipelines to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
-   **Collaboration**: We encourage **Pair/Mob Programming** for complex problems.
-   **Monitoring and Observability**: We use logging and monitoring tools to ensure application health in production.

### Specializations (docs/technical-guide/software-development/ai-and-machine-learning.md)

-   **AI and Machine Learning**: We use Python and MLOps practices to manage the entire lifecycle of AI projects, from problem identification to deployment and monitoring, with a strong focus on ethics and responsibility.
-   **Cloud**: We leverage cloud services (primarily Cloudflare, AWS, DigitalOcean) to ensure scalability, availability, and simplicity, with a strong preference for providers committed to sustainability and low carbon emissions.
-   **Security**: We integrate security practices throughout the development lifecycle, using tools like SonarQube for static analysis, Burp Suite/OWASP ZAP for penetration testing, and linters (RUFF for Python, ESLint for JS/TS) to ensure code quality and security.

## Sustainability

### Our Commitment (docs/sustainability/our-commitment.md)

As a 100% digital and remote company, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint in line with climate science and the Paris Agreement. We have adopted the **Science Based Targets (SBTi)** framework to guide our efforts. Our goals include reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 50% by 2030, reducing Scope 3 emissions by 30%, and achieving **carbon neutrality by 2040**.

### Strategy (docs/sustainability/our-commitment.md)
