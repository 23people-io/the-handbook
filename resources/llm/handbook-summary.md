## About Us

### Who We Are (about-us/who-we-are/)

**23people** is a technology company founded on November 26, 2014, by software engineers **Marcelo Ampuero** and **Manuel Reyes**. The company was created with the vision of being a place where they themselves would want to work, prioritizing people, passion for technology, and continuous learning. The name is inspired by the movie *The Matrix Reloaded*, symbolizing the spirit of the 23 individuals chosen to rebuild Zion. The company consists of approximately 90 professionals and is focused on building a sustainable business model that has a positive impact on society.

### What We Do (about-us/what-we-do/services.md)

23people acts as a trusted technological partner and co-creator for companies navigating their **digital evolution**. We help clients overcome challenges such as justifying the return on investment for technology, finding reliable partners, and selecting validated tech talent.

### What We Pursue (about-us/what-we-pursue/goals.md)

23people is driven by three primary long-term goals. First, to become a benchmark in Latin America for **high-performance IT teams, world-class digital platforms, and the use of AI tools**. Second, to achieve **sustainable economic growth and global expansion**, becoming a model for professional development and talent retention in the tech industry. Third, to **innovate by creating new digital products and services** leveraging an AI-native culture. Our strategy is guided by principles such as attracting top talent, competing on quality rather than price, and empowering everyone to contribute to the company's evolution.

## Organization

### Overview (organization/)

23people's organizational structure is designed to be circular to foster collaboration and communication. It is built around **autonomous, multidisciplinary teams** that operate as internal service providers. Each team has a clear purpose and offers its services through a well-defined contract, or **"API,"** which specifies deliverables and interaction protocols. This model allows teams to manage their internal processes freely while staying aligned with the company's strategic goals, which are set by a strategic body known as the **High Council**. The structure distinguishes between formal, permanent **Positions (Cargos)** and flexible, context-specific **Roles**.

### Teams (organization/teams/)

Our operational teams are grouped within the Iarvis Tribe and are structured to deliver specific value to the organization and its clients.

-   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)** (organization/teams/tech-talent-services/): The purpose of TTS is to provide the best experience in the **recruitment, technical validation, and retention** of tech professionals. They ensure that the talent not only has the required skills but also aligns with the client's projects and company culture.
-   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)** (organization/teams/sales-and-marketing/): This team is responsible for the **acquisition of new clients and the management of current commercial relationships**. Its purpose is to grow the 23people brand, market presence, and service adoption.
-   **Backoffice (BKO)** (organization/teams/backoffice/): BKO's purpose is to deliver the best **administrative support**, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions. It manages company administration, accounting and tax processes, and people management services.
-   **Research & Development (R&D)** (organization/teams/research-and-development/): The R&D team's purpose is to **power the digital evolution of our clients by exploring and mastering emerging technologies**. They focus on innovations that can generate tangible value in business operations.

### Tribes (organization/tribes/)

Tribes are macro-groups that unite teams with shared, high-level objectives, providing a sense of identity and common purpose.

-   **Iarvis Tribe** (organization/tribes/iarvis-tribe/): This tribe comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams: **Tech Talent Services (TTS), Sales & Marketing (SMKT), Backoffice (BKO), and Research & Development (R&D)**. Its collective purpose is to ensure the high-quality, sustainable delivery of services aligned with the company's strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe** (organization/tribes/drakkar-tribe/): This tribe includes all professionals and teams working in **subcontracting mode** directly on client projects. Its purpose is to deliver value to clients by providing the right talent to meet their specific project needs.

### Councils

Councils are governing bodies responsible for strategic alignment and operational coordination across the organization.

-   **High Council** (organization/): The High Council is the primary strategic team responsible for **defining and communicating the company's overall strategy**. It ensures that all operational teams and tribes are aligned with 23people's long-term vision and objectives.
-   **Iarvis Council** (organization/workforce/roles/global-operations-manager.md): This council operates within the Iarvis Tribe and is led by the Global Operations Manager. Its function is to **coordinate and align the operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D)**, ensuring seamless collaboration and execution of strategic initiatives.

### Workforce Structure (organization/workforce/roles/)

Our workforce is structured around two key concepts to provide both stability and flexibility. A **Position (Cargo)** is a formal, permanent placement within the organization that defines a person's hierarchical level and fundamental competencies. In contrast, a **Role** is a dynamic and context-specific set of responsibilities that a person takes on within a team or project. A single person in one Position can perform multiple Roles. This model is supported by key roles like the **Service Request Manager (SRM)**, who focuses on the 'what' and 'when' of a service request, and the **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**, who focuses on the 'how' and 'who' of its execution.

## Principles

### Fundamental Principles (principles/fundamentals/)

-   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are eternal learners who constantly improve our skills with genuine curiosity. We pursue excellence in our work through iterative, data-driven, and methodical practices.
-   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We work as a unified team, supporting each other with transparency and clear, honest communication. We co-create solutions and prioritize collective success over individual heroism.
-   **Sustainable Growth and Being a Reference**: We are ambitious about growing and becoming an international benchmark, but we do so at a sustainable pace that does not compromise our people, our values, or the planet.

### Culture and People Principles (principles/culture-and-people/)

-   **People First**: We believe we work to live, not the other way around. Our company is designed to serve human needs, fostering an environment of respect, empathy, and support for the personal and professional success of our employees and clients.
-   **Equity**: We are committed to treating everyone with respect and equality. We avoid all forms of discrimination in our selection processes, focusing on talent and potential. We apply positive discrimination only as a tie-breaker between equally qualified candidates to support underrepresented groups.
-   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction. Whether with clients, employees, or partners, we aim to build lasting relationships by consistently delivering value and showing that we care.

### Operational Principles (principles/operationals/)

-   **Agility**: We embrace agile principles to remain innovative, resilient, and efficient. This means valuing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change over rigid plans and processes.
-   **Transparency**: We make information public by default, with exceptions only for sensitive client, employee, or supplier data. We believe transparency fosters trust, collaboration, and productivity, even if it comes with minor costs.
-   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We favor remote work, digitalization, and eco-friendly technologies to minimize our environmental impact.

## Practices

### Agile Management (practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

We manage work, not people, using a system based on **Kanban** principles. This approach allows us to visualize our workflow on boards divided into sequential areas: **Backlog**, **Requested**, **In Progress**, **Done**, and **Ready to Archive**. By limiting work-in-progress (WIP), we encourage a focus on completing tasks before starting new ones, which improves flow and efficiency. This visual system fosters collaboration, helps identify bottlenecks, and supports our culture of continuous improvement.

### Communication (practices/communication/asynchronous-communication.md)

We prioritize **asynchronous communication** to protect focus time and allow for thoughtful, well-articulated responses. This reduces interruptions and supports collaboration across different time zones. To ensure clarity, especially when presenting initiatives or complex problems, we structure our narrative using a logical framework: start with the **Context** (Situation, Complication, Question) and then provide the **Response** (direct Answer, Key Arguments, and Supporting Details).

### Learning (practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We embrace the practice of "learning how to learn" to deepen our understanding and retain knowledge effectively. Our method involves selecting a topic, studying it, and then **explaining it in simple terms as if teaching someone else**. This process reveals gaps in our understanding, which we then fill by returning to the material. We repeat this cycle until the explanation is clear, concise, and can be conveyed through simple language or an analogy, ensuring profound comprehension.

### Using AI (practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

We leverage Artificial Intelligence as a **capability multiplier** to enhance productivity and maintain quality standards. We use tools like **Claude Projects**, which are pre-configured with specific instructions to automate repetitive tasks such as drafting documents or creating detailed Kanban card descriptions. It is a core principle that AI-generated output is always treated as a **first draft**. Every output must be reviewed, edited, and validated by a professional to ensure it meets our standards for quality, accuracy, and context.

## Community

### Benefits Framework (community/benefits/)

23people offers a comprehensive benefits framework available to all employees after a three-month ramp-up period, designed to support their physical, mental, and professional well-being. The benefits are organized into several categories:

-   **Agreements**: Partnerships that provide access to complementary health and dental insurance, life insurance, and preferential banking plans.
-   **Incentives**: Financial bonuses and perks, including an incentive for taking vacations, birthday gifts, a day off for birthdays, and bonuses for national holidays and Christmas.
-   **Refunds**: Reimbursement policies covering expenses for professional development such as courses and international certifications, improvements to home-office setups, and annual flu vaccinations.
-   **Trainings**: Company-funded learning opportunities, such as ongoing English language classes.

### Procedures (community/procedures/administratives.md)

The company maintains standardized procedures for common administrative and operational tasks to ensure consistency and efficiency. This includes documented processes for **financial matters** like submitting expense reports for reimbursement and fund accountability. Additionally, there are clear guidelines for technical operations, such as the procedure for **onboarding new members to the company's Discord server**, which covers sending invitations and assigning the correct roles.

### Events (community/events/)

23people organizes various community events to foster team cohesion and collaboration. Official photographs and videos from these events are centrally stored and managed. Access to this media is maintained in a **shared Google Drive**, with permissions restricted to the **Marketing** and **People Growth** teams to ensure proper handling and distribution of content.

## Technical Guide

### Software Development Principles (technical-guide/software-development/principles.md)

Our software development philosophy is rooted in **simplicity** and creating tangible business value. We balance **Object-Oriented (OOP) and Functional Programming** paradigms to build modular and predictable code. We strictly adhere to **SOLID principles** (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to ensure our architecture is robust and maintainable. Every project is driven by a deep understanding of the business need, and we design solutions for **scalability and maintainability** from day one.

### Methodologies (technical-guide/software-development/methodologies.md)

We employ an agile approach based on the **Kanban method** to manage our development workflow. This methodology allows us to visualize our work on boards, limit the amount of work in progress (WIP), and focus on a continuous flow of delivery. It provides the flexibility to adapt to project-specific needs, integrating other agile ceremonies like retrospectives as needed, while maintaining a core focus on optimizing workflow efficiency and promoting continuous improvement.

### Technologies (technical-guide/software-development/technologies.md)

We use a carefully selected, modern tech stack designed for scalability, performance, and developer efficiency. Our primary technologies include **Node.js with the NestJS framework** for building robust backends, and **React** for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. For data-intensive and AI projects, **Python** is our language of choice, supported by its rich ecosystem. We utilize both **MongoDB** for flexible, document-based data storage and **PostgreSQL** for reliable, structured relational data.

### Practices (technical-guide/software-development/practices.md)

We follow a set of standard best practices to ensure code quality, consistency, and efficient collaboration. All code is managed using **Git** with a structured branching workflow. **Code reviews** are mandatory for all changes to promote knowledge sharing and maintain high standards. We rely heavily on **automated testing** (unit, integration, and end-to-end) and **CI/CD pipelines** to automate builds, tests, and deployments. We also encourage **Pair/Mob Programming** for complex problem-solving and maintain lightweight, practical documentation.

### Specializations (technical-guide/software-development/)

-   **AI and Machine Learning**: We specialize in developing AI/ML solutions, primarily using **Python** and its ecosystem (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Our process follows a structured lifecycle, from problem identification and data cleaning to model training and deployment via **MLOps** practices, ensuring our models are robust and monitored in production.
-   **Cloud Infrastructure**: Our infrastructure is built on modern cloud services, with a preference for platforms that align with our sustainability goals like **Cloudflare and AWS**. We use serverless solutions (Cloudflare Workers), managed services (AWS Cognito), and object storage (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3) to build scalable, simple, and resilient systems.
-   **Security**: Security is integrated throughout our development process. We use static code analysis tools like **SonarQube**, linters such as **ESLint** and **Ruff**, and automated penetration testing tools like **OWASP ZAP**. These tools are embedded in our CI/CD pipelines to detect vulnerabilities early and enforce security best practices.
