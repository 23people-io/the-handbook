## About Us

### Who We Are

**23people is a technology company founded on November 26, 2014, by two passionate software engineers, Marcelo Ampuero and Manuel Reyes**, who still lead the company. The founding principle was to "create a company where we would have liked to work"—a place that puts people first, fosters a passion for technology, and values continuous learning. We are a team of professionals who are genuinely passionate about what we do. The company's name, "23people," is inspired by a concept from the movie *The Matrix Reloaded*, representing the spirit of those chosen to rebuild Zion.

(https://manual.23people.io/about-us/what-we-pursue/)

## Organization

### Overview

23people is organized into **multidisciplinary teams with a circular structure** to foster collaboration and open communication. Each team operates with a clear, well-defined purpose and a high degree of autonomy. The core principles guiding our teams are:

*   **Clear and defined purpose**: Every team has a "North Star" that guides its daily activities.
*   **Autonomy around purpose**: Teams decide *how* to achieve their goals, aligned with company strategy.
*   **Service contracts (API-like)**: Each team delivers services to internal or external clients through well-defined service contracts.
*   **Data-driven iterative improvement**: Teams constantly measure and improve their services based on data and accumulated experience.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

### Teams

Our operations are carried out by four main teams that form the Iarvis Tribe:

*   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in recruiting, validating, and retaining tech professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
*   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
*   **Backoffice (BKO)**: Provides agile and efficient administrative support in people management, financial management, and company management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
*   **Research & Development (R&D)**: Empowers clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real business value.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/teams/)

### Tribes

We use the concept of **Tribes** to group teams with shared objectives. There are two main tribes:

*   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all the operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D) that run the core business of 23people. Its purpose is to deliver high-quality, sustainable services aligned with strategic goals.
*   **Drakkar Tribe**: Consists of all tech professionals and teams working on an outsourcing basis directly with our clients. Its purpose is to ensure we have the right talent to meet client needs.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/tribes/)

### Councils

Strategic alignment and operational coordination are managed by councils:

*   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's overall strategy and ensuring that operational teams are aligned with it.
*   **Iarvis Council**: An operational body that coordinates the Iarvis Tribe teams, ensuring collaboration and alignment in execution.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

### Workforce Structure

We distinguish between **Positions** and **Roles** to provide both structure and flexibility:

*   **Positions** (Cargos): Define a professional's capabilities, level of seniority, and hierarchical standing within the company (e.g., Senior Operations Director). They represent a career path.
*   **Roles**: Define specific, dynamic responsibilities that a professional undertakes within a particular team or project (e.g., Service Request Manager, Tech Lead). A person in one position can perform different roles across the organization.

Key operational roles include the **Service Request Manager (SRM)**, who manages the "what" and "when" of service requests as the client interface, and the **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**, who manages the "how" and "who," ensuring efficient workflow and quality delivery.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/workforce/)

## Principles

Our actions and decisions are guided by nine core principles, categorized into three groups.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/)

### Fundamental Principles

These define our organizational essence.

*   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are eternal learners who pursue excellence in everything we do. We have an open mind and use iterative, data-driven methods to consolidate our knowledge.
*   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We genuinely support each other and our clients. We work as a team, sharing responsibilities and prioritizing clear, honest communication.
*   **Sustainable Growth and Being Referents**: We are ambitious about growing and becoming international leaders, but we do so at a systematic and sustainable pace that respects our people, clients, and the planet.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/fundamentals/)

### Culture and People Principles

These shape how we interact with each other and our stakeholders.

*   **People First**: We work to live, not live to work. We prioritize the well-being and personal success of our team members and clients, fostering a culture of empathy, respect, and collaboration over hierarchy.
*   **Equity**: We believe in a humane and motivating environment where everyone is treated with respect. We avoid all forms of discrimination in our selection processes, focusing on talent and potential.
*   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction—for clients, tech professionals, administrative staff, and suppliers alike.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/culture-and-people/)

### Operational Principles

These guide how we work and operate.

*   **Agility**: We adhere to agile values to be innovative, resilient, and efficient. This allows us to adapt to change, foster continuous improvement, and minimize waste.
*   **Transparency**: We make information public by default, except for sensitive client, employee, or supplier data. We believe transparency fosters trust, productivity, and collaboration.
*   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision, ensuring the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We favor remote work and digital processes to minimize our environmental impact.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/operationals/)

## Practices

These are the established ways of working that form our company culture.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/)

### Agile Management

**We manage the work, not the people.** Our approach is based on **Kanban** principles to ensure a visual, systematic, and efficient workflow. Key practices include:

*   **Visual Workflows**: Using Kanban boards with clear stages (e.g., Backlog, Requested, In Progress, Done) to provide visibility into all work items.
*   **WIP (Work in Progress) Limits**: Limiting the number of active tasks to encourage focus and completion.
*   **Daily Meetings**: A structured daily check-in to review the board from right to left (closest to "Done" first), celebrate progress, address blockers, and define the day's focus.
*   **Documenting Decisions**: We prefer to document decisions rather than relying on memory, ensuring clarity and historical context.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/agile-management/)

### Communication

*   **Asynchronous-First**: We prefer asynchronous communication (e.g., written messages, documents) to allow focused work and respect different schedules.
*   **Write First, Then Communicate**: We encourage writing down ideas to clarify them before sharing them widely. This improves the quality of communication.
*   **Structured Narrative**: We use a **Context-Response** framework to present initiatives or problems, ensuring all stakeholders understand the "why" before the "what" and "how."
*   **Acknowledge Promptly**: We provide quick acknowledgements of messages to reduce uncertainty and anxiety for the sender.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/communication/)

### Learning

We employ a "learn how to learn" technique based on the Feynman method, which involves:
1.  Studying a topic.
2.  Explaining it in simple terms as if teaching someone else.
3.  Identifying and reviewing knowledge gaps.
4.  Simplifying the language and using analogies until the explanation is clear and concise.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/learning/)

### Using AI

We view **AI as a multiplier of professional capabilities**. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to automate repetitive tasks, generate initial drafts, and maintain quality standards. The key principle is that AI provides a starting point, but **the professional is always responsible for reviewing, editing, and owning the final output**. We never input sensitive or confidential information into AI models.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/using-ai/)

## Community

### Benefits Framework

We offer a range of benefits designed to support the physical, mental, and professional well-being of our team. Eligibility for most benefits begins after three months of seniority. The framework includes:

*   **Agreements**: Partnerships that provide access to services like the **Betterfly** wellness platform and comprehensive **complementary health, dental, catastrophic, and life insurance**.
*   **Incentives**: Financial bonuses to encourage rest and celebrate important dates, including an **incentive for taking vacations**, birthday gifts, and bonuses for national holidays and Christmas.
*   **Refunds**: Reimbursement for expenses that support professional growth and well-being, such as **international certifications**, online **courses**, improvements to the **home office workspace**, and the annual influenza vaccine.
*   **Trainings**: Company-sponsored learning opportunities, such as group **English classes**.

(https://manual.23people.io/community/benefits/)

### Procedures

We maintain standardized administrative procedures for processes such as expense reports and handling Discord server invitations, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

(https://manual.23people.io/community/procedures/)

### Events

We organize company events to foster community and collaboration. Photos and videos from these events are stored in a shared, centralized repository.

(https://manual.23people.io/community/events/)
