## Practices

### Agile Management (practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

We **manage the work, not the people**, using **Kanban** as our core agile methodology. This approach allows us to visualize workflows, limit work in progress (WIP) to maximize efficiency, and foster continuous improvement. Our Kanban boards are typically structured into five areas: **Backlog**, **Requested** (committed work), **In Progress**, **Done**, and **Ready to Archive**. This system promotes a focus on flow, collaboration, and delivering value systematically.
