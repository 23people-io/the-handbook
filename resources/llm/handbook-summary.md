## Organization

### Overview

**23people is organized into multidisciplinary, purpose-driven teams with a circular structure that fosters collaboration and communication.** Each team operates with autonomy, delivering services to internal teams or external clients through well-defined service contracts, similar to an **API**. This model requires each team to specify what it delivers, what to expect from its service, and how to request it. Teams are expected to continuously measure and improve their service quality and operational efficiency based on data and accumulated experience. The organizational structure is designed to support both technical and management career paths, ensuring alignment from daily tasks to long-term strategic goals.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

### Teams

The company's operational functions are carried out by four primary teams, which are collectively part of the Iarvis Tribe:

*   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of tech professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for client projects.
*   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
*   **Backoffice (BKO)**: Provides agile and efficient administrative support in People Management, Financial Management, and Company Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
*   **Research & Development (R&D)**: Drives clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real business value.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/#equipos-operacionales)

### Tribes

Teams are grouped into **Tribes** that share common objectives. There are two main tribes:

*   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all the internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D) that drive the company's core functions. Its purpose is to deliver high-quality, sustainable services aligned with strategic goals.
*   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all tech professionals and teams working on a subcontracting basis for client projects. Its purpose is to ensure that 23people has the right talent to meet client needs.

*   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy, ensuring that all operational teams are aligned with it.
*   **Iarvis Council**: Responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/#equipo-estrategico)

### Workforce Structure

Our structure distinguishes between **Positions** (Cargos), which define a professional's level and capabilities within the organization, and **Roles**, which are specific responsibilities assumed within a team or project. This flexibility allows professionals to apply their skills across different contexts.

We define three main seniority levels based on skill development, not years of experience:

*   **Entry**: A professional starting their career, requiring guidance to complete tasks efficiently while learning continuously.
*   **Intermediate**: A professional with proven experience who serves as a reference for others, assuming responsibilities with confidence.
*   **Senior**: A professional with deep expertise who acts as an undisputed benchmark in best practices, capable of taking on leadership roles like Tech Lead, Team Lead, or Architect.

(https://manual.23people.io/about-us/how-we-work/tech-roles/#niveles)

## Principles

Our actions and decisions are guided by a set of nine core principles, categorized to reflect our identity, culture, and operations.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/)

*   **Sustainable Growth and Leadership**: We are ambitious about growing and becoming international benchmarks, but we do so at a sustainable pace that respects our people, clients, and the planet.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/fundamentals/)

### Culture and People Principles

These principles shape our interactions with each other and our stakeholders.

*   **People First**: We work to live, not live to work. We prioritize the well-being and professional growth of our team, fostering an environment of respect, empathy, and mutual benefit.
*   **Equity**: We believe in treating everyone with respect and equality, avoiding any form of discrimination in our selection and work processes.
*   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction—with clients, professionals, and partners—to build lasting, value-driven relationships.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/culture-and-people/)

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/operationals/)

## Practices

### Agile Management

We manage our work, not our people, using **Kanban** as our primary agile methodology. This involves visualizing workflows on shared boards, limiting **Work-in-Progress (WIP)** to prevent overload and encourage task completion, and fostering continuous improvement. Each team has autonomy over its processes but adheres to a common structure of work areas (Backlog, Requested, In Progress, Done, Archive). We use **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** to align our work with strategic company goals.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people/)

### Communication

We prioritize effective and collaborative communication through several key practices:

*   **Asynchronous Communication First**: We prefer asynchronous channels to allow colleagues to manage their time and focus without constant interruptions.
*   **Write Then Communicate**: We encourage writing down ideas before sharing them to foster clarity, reflection, and create a written record of decisions.
*   **Structured Narratives**: When presenting initiatives or problems, we use a structured narrative (Context, Question, Answer) to ensure clarity and impact.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/communication/)

### Learning

We promote a culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. A key technique we advocate is to **learn by teaching**. This involves selecting a topic, studying it, explaining it in simple terms as if teaching someone else, identifying knowledge gaps, and refining the explanation until it is clear and concise. This process ensures deep understanding and long-term retention of knowledge.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/learning/how-to-learn/)

### Using AI

We view Artificial Intelligence as a **capability multiplier** for our professionals. We use AI tools like **Claude Projects** to automate repetitive tasks, create standardized documentation drafts, and free up our teams to focus on higher-value activities. We treat AI-generated content as a starting point or draft that always requires professional review, editing, and contextualization to ensure quality and accuracy. Confidentiality is paramount; no sensitive data is shared with these tools.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/using-ai/claude-project/)

## Community

### Benefits Framework

23people offers a range of benefits designed to support the physical, mental, and professional well-being of our team members. Most benefits are available to all employees with at least three months of seniority. The framework includes:

*   **Agreements**: Partnerships with providers like **Betterfly** for wellness and insurance, **Banco de Chile** for banking services, and **Zurich** for complementary health, dental, life, and catastrophic insurance.
