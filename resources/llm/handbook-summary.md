## About Us

### Who We Are

**23people** is a technology company founded in Santiago, Chile, on November 26, 2014, by software engineers **Marcelo Ampuero** and **Manuel Reyes**. The founding principle was to create a company where they themselves would have loved to work—a place that puts people first, fosters a passion for technology, and prioritizes collaboration and respect over hierarchy. Our name is inspired by the movie *The Matrix Reloaded*, representing the spirit of the 23 individuals selected to rebuild Zion. We are a team of professionals passionate about technology, committed to creating a sustainable business model and making a positive impact on society. The company has grown to approximately 90 professionals and has served over 10 large companies across three continents.

## Organization

### Overview

23people is organized into **multidisciplinary teams** with a **circular structure** to foster collaboration and communication. Each team has a clear, well-defined purpose and operates with autonomy to achieve its goals, delivering services to other internal teams or external clients.

The internal model for each team functions like an **API**, with a clear service contract defining what it delivers, what to expect, and how to request its services. Teams are expected to continuously measure the quality and operational efficiency of their services and improve them iteratively based on data and accumulated experience.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

### Teams

Our operational teams are grouped under the **Iarvis Tribe** and include:

-   **Tech Talent Services Team (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of tech professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing Team (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
-   **Backoffice Services Team (BKO)**: Provides the best administrative support to enable other teams to focus on their core functions. Services include People Management, Financial Management, and Company Management.
-   **Research & Development Team (R&D)**: Empowers our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real value for their operations.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/teams/)

### Tribes

We use the concept of **Tribes** to group teams with shared objectives. There are two main tribes:

-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to drive the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with the company's strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all tech professionals and teams working on a subcontracting basis for our clients. Its purpose is to ensure we have the right talent to meet client needs effectively.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/tribes/)

### Councils

Strategic alignment and operational coordination are facilitated through councils:

-   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy, ensuring that all operational teams are aligned with it.
-   **Iarvis Council**: Responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe. It is led by the Global Operations Manager.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/councils/)

### Workforce Structure

Our organizational structure is based on a clear distinction between **Positions** and **Roles**.

-   **Positions (Cargos)**: Define a professional's level within the organizational hierarchy, their expected capabilities, and their career path. A position is stable and not tied to a specific team.
-   **Roles**: Define a specific scope of action and concrete responsibilities that a professional assumes in a particular context, such as a team or project. Roles are dynamic and can change based on needs.

Key operational roles include:

-   **Global Operations Manager**: Orchestrates the operational execution of the Iarvis Tribe's teams, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives.
-   **Service Request Manager (SRM)**: Manages the "what" and "when" of service requests, acting as the primary point of contact for clients and defining priorities.
-   **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**: Manages the "how" and "who" of service delivery, ensuring quality, efficiency, and continuous improvement of the workflow.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/fundamentals/)

### Culture and People Principles

These principles define how we interact with each other and our stakeholders.

-   **People First**: We work to live, not live to work. We prioritize the well-being and professional growth of our team, creating a respectful and empathetic environment. The success of our clients and collaborators is our success.
-   **Equity**: We believe in a humane and motivating company where everyone is treated with respect and equality. We avoid all forms of discrimination in our selection processes, as talent is uniformly distributed in society.
-   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction, whether with clients, tech professionals, administrative staff, or suppliers, to build lasting and valuable relationships.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/culture-and-people/)

### Operational Principles

These principles guide how we work and operate as an organization.

-   **Agility**: We embrace agile principles to be innovative, resilient, and efficient. We value individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
-   **Transparency**: We make information public by default, with exceptions for confidential client, employee, or supplier data. We believe transparency fosters productivity, trust, and collaboration.
-   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that involves the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We prioritize remote work, digitalization, and technologies that reduce our environmental impact.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/operationals/)

## Practices

### Agile Management

We practice **managing the work, not the people**, using **Kanban** principles to visualize workflows and maximize efficiency. Our work is organized on visual boards with distinct stages: **Backlog Area** (unrefined ideas), **Requested Area** (committed work), **In Progress Area** (active work), **Done Area** (completed work), and **Ready to Archive Area**. This approach helps us limit work-in-progress (WIP), focus on finishing tasks, identify bottlenecks, and foster a culture of continuous improvement. Daily meetings are structured to review the board from right to left (closest to "Done" first) to prioritize completing work over starting new work.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/agile-management/)

### Communication

Our communication practices are designed to be effective and collaborative.

-   **Prefer Asynchronous Communication**: This allows team members to manage their time and energy efficiently, facilitates collaboration across different time zones, and creates a record of conversations.
-   **Write Ideas Before Sharing**: We encourage writing down ideas before communicating them to ensure clarity, foster deeper reflection, and produce more thoughtful responses.
-   **Structure Narratives**: When presenting initiatives or problems, we use a structured narrative: **Context** (Situation, Complication, Question) and **Response** (Main Conclusion, Key Arguments, Supporting Details). This ensures clear and effective communication.
-   **Acknowledge Promptly**: We acknowledge receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce anxiety and confirm that the communication has been received.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/communication/)

### Learning

We follow a structured technique for **learning how to learn**. This involves selecting a topic, explaining it in simple terms as if teaching someone else, identifying knowledge gaps and restudying them, and simplifying the language until the concept is thoroughly understood. This method ensures deep comprehension and long-term retention of knowledge.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/learning/)

### Using AI

We leverage AI, specifically **Claude Projects**, as a **capability multiplier** to automate recurring tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our professionals for higher-value activities. The AI-generated content is treated as a **first draft**, which must be reviewed, edited, and contextualized by a professional. This approach aligns with our value of "Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity" by using technology to enhance our processes. We maintain a catalog of pre-configured Claude Projects for tasks like creating Kanban card descriptions.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/using-ai/)

## Community

### Benefits Framework

We strive to offer benefits that improve the physical, mental, and professional well-being of our team. Most benefits are available to all employees with at least **three months of tenure**. The framework includes:

-   **Agreements**: Access to platforms like **Betterfly** (wellness app and life insurance), complementary health and dental insurance, and a banking agreement with Banco de Chile. The company covers 100% of the employee's health insurance premium.
-   **Incentives**: We offer economic incentives for taking vacations (minimum 5 consecutive business days), birthday gifts, a paid day off for birthdays, bonuses for national holidays and Christmas, and a baby shower bonus for new parents.
-   **Refunds**: We provide reimbursement for expenses related to international certifications, professional development courses, home office setup improvements, and the annual influenza vaccine.
-   **Trainings**: The company offers group English classes to help employees improve their language skills.

(https://manual.23people.io/community/benefits/)

### Procedures

We maintain standardized administrative procedures for tasks such as expense reporting and fund rendering to ensure consistency and efficiency. We also have a clear process for onboarding new members to our company's Discord server to facilitate smooth integration into our communication channels.

(https://manual.23people.io/community/procedures/)

### Events

We document our company culture and community through photos and videos from events such as business trips, industry fairs, and team gatherings. This audiovisual material is stored in a shared, access-restricted drive for marketing and people management purposes.

(https://manual.23people.io/community/events/)
