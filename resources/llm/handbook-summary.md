## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized into **multidisciplinary teams** with a circular structure to foster collaboration. Each team operates with a clear purpose and autonomy, delivering services to internal teams or external clients. Our organizational model is inspired by software APIs, where each team offers a well-defined "contract" of services, specifying what they deliver, what to expect, and how to request their services. This model promotes autonomy while ensuring alignment with the company's strategic objectives through iterative, data-driven improvement.

### Teams (docs/organization/teams/index.md)

Our operational teams are the core of our service delivery, each with a distinct purpose:

*   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: To provide the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
*   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing relationships with current ones, and growing the 23people brand, presence, and market share.
*   **Backoffice (BKO)**: To deliver the best administrative support, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions through agile and efficient management of people, finances, and company services.
*   **Research & Development (R&D)**: To drive our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real value in their operations.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

Teams are grouped into two main **Tribes** that share common objectives:

*   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to enable the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with the company's strategic goals.
*   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all teams and professionals working on a subcontracted basis for our clients, either as dedicated teams or as individual contributors. It is fundamental to our client service delivery.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

Strategic alignment and operational coordination are facilitated by councils:

*   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's overall strategy, ensuring that all operational teams are aligned with it.
*   **Iarvis Council**: Defined by the Global Operations Manager, this council is responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/workforce/positions/index.md)

Our workforce is structured around two key concepts that provide both stability and flexibility:

*   **Positions (Cargos)**: These are formal, relatively permanent titles within the organizational structure (e.g., Senior Software Engineer). A position defines a level, core competencies, and required skills, and is held by a single person.
*   **Roles**: These are flexible, dynamic assignments that define specific responsibilities and functions within a particular context, such as a team or project (e.g., Tech Lead). A person in one position can perform multiple roles across different teams.
*   **Seniority Levels**: We define three main levels of seniority—**Entry**, **Intermediate**, and **Senior**—based on the demonstrated development of skills and acquired learning, rather than years of experience. Higher levels imply greater autonomy, scope of responsibility, and strategic impact.

## Principles

### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)

These principles define our core identity and guide our daily actions.

*   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are lifelong learners who pursue excellence in everything we do. We have an open mindset, embrace iterative and data-driven work, and are passionate about technology.
*   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We work as a team, supporting each other and our clients with honesty and transparency. We prioritize clear communication, assume good will, and favor open channels to build trust and productivity.

We prioritize long-term, systematic progress over short-term, exhausting efforts, ensuring we do not compromise the well-being of our team, clients, or planet.

### Culture and People Principles (docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)

These principles shape our interactions and define our community.

*   **People First**: We work to live, not live to work. We prioritize mutual benefit, respect, and empathy in all relationships, recognizing that behind every professional is a unique person. We believe in leaders, not bosses, and collaboration over individual heroism.
*   **Equity**: We believe in a humane and motivating environment where everyone is treated with respect. We avoid all forms of discrimination in our selection processes, focusing on talent, which is uniformly distributed in society.

*   **Manage Work, Not People**: We use visual workflows, primarily **Kanban**, to manage our work. This allows us to visualize tasks, limit work-in-progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. We focus on optimizing the flow of work rather than micromanaging individuals.
*   **Use OKRs**: We use Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to align our teams with the company's strategic goals, ensuring that our initiatives contribute to the bigger picture.
*   **Document Decisions**: We prefer to document important decisions rather than relying on individual memory. This creates a transparent and accessible record that supports asynchronous work and knowledge sharing.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

*   **Asynchronous-First**: We prioritize asynchronous communication to allow team members to manage their time effectively and provide thoughtful, well-crafted responses. This reduces interruptions and supports collaboration across different time zones.
*   **Write Then Communicate**: We encourage writing down ideas before sharing them. This practice helps clarify thoughts, facilitates better decision-making, and creates a documented history of discussions.
*   **Structured Narratives**: We use a structured narrative (Context, Question, Answer) when presenting initiatives or problems. This ensures clarity, consistency, and effective communication across the organization.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

*   **Learn How to Learn**: We follow a technique for effective learning that involves selecting a topic, explaining it as if teaching someone else, identifying knowledge gaps, and simplifying the language. This method promotes deep understanding and long-term retention of knowledge, aligning with our value of intellectual curiosity.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/index.md)

*   **AI as a Capability Multiplier**: We use AI tools like **Claude Projects** to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our professionals to focus on higher-value activities. We treat AI-generated content as a starting point that requires professional review and refinement, not as a final product.

## Community
