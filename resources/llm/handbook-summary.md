## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized in a **circular structure** to foster collaboration and communication between multidisciplinary teams and organizational layers. Each operational team has a clear purpose and delivers services to other internal teams or external clients through well-defined **service contracts**, similar to how an **API** works. This model grants teams autonomy to achieve their purpose while ensuring alignment with the company's strategic goals. We distinguish between **Positions (Cargos)**, which define a professional's capabilities and hierarchical level, and **Roles**, which are specific, dynamic sets of responsibilities within a team or project.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)

Our operational teams are the core of our service delivery:

-   **Tech Talent Services Team (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the recruitment, technical validation, and retention of tech professionals who are a strong match for our clients' projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing Team (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand, presence, and market share.
-   **Backoffice Team (BKO)**: Provides the best administrative support in company, accounting, and people management, enabling our teams to focus on their core functions.
-   **Research & Development Team (R&D)**: Drives our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies to generate tangible business value.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

Teams are grouped into two **Tribes** that share common objectives:

-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D) that work together to support the company's strategic goals and core functions.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Consists of all tech professionals and teams working in subcontracting mode on client projects, forming the core of our external service delivery.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

Strategic alignment and operational coordination are managed through councils:

-   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the company's overall strategy, ensuring all operational teams are aligned with these objectives.
-   **Iarvis Council**: An operational body, led by the Global Operations Manager, that coordinates and aligns the activities of the teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)

Our workforce is structured around two key concepts:

-   **Positions (Cargos)**: Define a professional's level within the organization based on experience, skills, and strategic contribution. Higher levels imply greater autonomy and responsibility. Positions are consistent across the company.
-   **Roles**: Define a specific set of responsibilities a professional undertakes within a particular context, such as a team or project. A single person can hold multiple roles, and roles are dynamic. For example, a Senior Software Engineer (Position) can perform the role of a Tech Lead on a project.

## Principles

### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)

These principles define our core identity and guide our actions.

-   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We co-create solutions through genuine support, honest transparency, and clear communication. We work as a team, sharing responsibilities and celebrating successes together.
-   **Sustainable Growth and Industry Leadership**: We are ambitious about growing and becoming international benchmarks, but we do so at a sustainable pace that respects our people, clients, and planet. We prioritize systematic progress over short-term, exhaustive efforts.

### Culture and People Principles (docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)

These principles shape our interactions and work environment.

-   **People First**: We work to live, not live to work. We prioritize the well-being and personal success of our team members and clients, fostering an environment of respect, empathy, and collaboration over hierarchy.
-   **Equity**: We believe in treating everyone with respect and fairness. We avoid all forms of discrimination in our selection processes, focusing on talent and potential, and apply positive discrimination only as a tie-breaker to support underrepresented groups.
-   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction—for clients, tech professionals, administrative staff, and suppliers—to build lasting, value-driven relationships.

### Operational Principles (docs/principles/operationals/index.md)

These principles guide how we operate and deliver our services.

-   **Agility**: We adhere to agile values to remain innovative, resilient, and efficient. This means prioritizing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

-   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We prioritize remote work, digitalization, and technologies that minimize environmental impact.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

We **manage the work, not the people**, using **Kanban** principles to visualize workflow, limit work in progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. Our Kanban boards are typically structured with five main areas: **Backlog**, **Requested** (committed work), **In Progress**, **Done**, and **Archive**. This system provides clarity on all work items (e.g., Service Requests, Incidents, Internal Improvements), helps identify bottlenecks, and fosters a culture of finishing tasks before starting new ones. Daily meetings are conducted by walking the board from right to left to focus on unblocking and completing work.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

Our communication is guided by practices that enhance clarity and efficiency. We prefer **asynchronous communication** to allow team members to manage their time effectively and provide thoughtful responses. We encourage **writing ideas down before communicating them** to ensure clarity. For presenting initiatives or problems, we use a structured narrative based on the **SCQA framework**: providing **Context** (Situation, Complication, Question) before presenting the **Response** (Conclusion, Key Arguments, Supporting Details).

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We champion the practice of "learning how to learn." We use a technique inspired by the Feynman method: select a topic, explain it in simple terms as if teaching someone else, identify knowledge gaps when stuck, study to fill them, and then simplify the explanation further. This process ensures a deep and lasting understanding of new concepts, aligning with our value of intellectual curiosity.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

We view **AI as a multiplier of our professional capabilities**. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to create dedicated workspaces with pre-defined instructions for recurring tasks. This helps us automate the creation of initial drafts for documents like Kanban card descriptions, saving time, ensuring consistency, and allowing our team to focus on higher-value activities. The content generated by AI is always treated as a **starting point** that requires professional review, editing, and contextualization.

## Community

### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)

We offer a range of benefits to support our team's physical, mental, and professional well-being, generally available to everyone after a three-month ramp-up period. The framework includes:

-   **Agreements**: Partnerships that provide access to services like the **Betterfly** wellness app, preferential banking plans with **Banco de Chile**, and comprehensive **complementary health, dental, and life insurance**.
-   **Incentives**: Financial bonuses to encourage rest and celebrate life events, such as an **incentive for taking vacation weeks**, a **birthday gift**, bonuses for **national holidays and Christmas**, and a **baby shower bonus**.
-   **Refunds**: Reimbursement programs for professional development and well-being, including **international certifications**, online **courses**, an annual allowance for **improving home office workspaces**, and the annual **influenza vaccination**.
-   **Trainings**: Company-sponsored learning opportunities, such as group **English classes**.

### Procedures (docs/community/procedures/administratives.md)

We maintain clear and documented administrative procedures to ensure efficiency and transparency. This includes standardized processes for tasks such as **expense reports and reimbursements**, which are accessible to all team members.

### Events (docs/community/events/index.md)

We foster a sense of community through various events. Official photographs and videos from these gatherings are stored and shared internally via a dedicated Google Drive, creating a lasting record of our shared experiences.

## Technical Guide

### Software Development Principles (docs/technical-guide/software-development/principles.md)

Our development philosophy is rooted in simplifying real-world problems. Key principles include:

-   **Simplicity Above All**: We strive for the most direct and efficient solutions, eliminating unnecessary complexity in architecture and code.
