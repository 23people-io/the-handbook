## About Us

### Who We Are

**23people SpA** is a technology company founded in Santiago, Chile, on November 26, 2014, by software engineers Marcelo Ampuero and Manuel Reyes. The company was founded on the principle of creating a workplace where they themselves would want to work—one that puts people first, values passion for technology, and fosters continuous learning. Our name is inspired by a concept from the film *The Matrix Reloaded*, representing the spirit of those chosen to rebuild a new world. We are a team of professionals who are passionate about technology and dedicated to creating an exceptional work environment.

## Organization

### Overview

23people is organized in a **circular structure** of multidisciplinary teams to foster collaboration and communication. Each team operates with autonomy around a clear, well-defined purpose. Teams deliver their services to internal teams or external clients through **service contracts**, which function like APIs by specifying what the service delivers, what to expect, and how to request it. This model emphasizes data-driven, iterative improvement to enhance operational efficiency and service quality.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

### Teams

Our operational teams are grouped within the Iarvis Tribe and are structured to deliver specific value to the organization and its clients.

-   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Provides the best experience in the recruitment, technical validation, and retention of tech professionals who align with our clients' projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Manages new client acquisition, maintains current commercial relationships, and grows the 23people brand and market presence.
-   **Backoffice (BKO)**: Delivers agile and efficient administrative support in People Management, Financial Management, and Company Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
-   **Research & Development (R&D)**: Explores and masters emerging technologies to create tangible value in our clients' operations and drive our internal digital evolution.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/teams/)

### Tribes

Teams are grouped into **Tribes** that share common objectives. This structure helps align efforts across different parts of the organization.

-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D), focused on enabling and delivering high-quality, sustainable services.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Consists of all tech professionals and teams working in subcontracting mode on client projects, forming the core of our service delivery to clients.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/tribes/)

### Councils

Councils are strategic and coordinating bodies that ensure alignment across the organization.

-   **Iarvis Council**: A body led by the Global Operations Manager that coordinates the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe, ensuring effective collaboration and alignment on strategic initiatives.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

### Workforce Structure

We distinguish between **Positions (Cargos)** and **Roles** to provide organizational clarity and flexibility.

-   A **Position** is a formal title and level within the company hierarchy (e.g., Senior Software Engineer). It defines a professional's capabilities and career level.
-   A **Role** is a specific set of responsibilities and functions that a professional assumes in a particular context, such as on a team or project (e.g., Tech Lead, Technical Interviewer).

This flexible structure allows professionals to apply their skills in various contexts, facilitating internal mobility and professional development. Key operational roles include the **Service Request Manager (SRM)**, who manages the "what" and "when" of service requests, and the **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**, who manages the "how" and "who" of service execution.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

## Principles

Our principles are the guiding rules that shape our behaviors and decisions. They are organized into three distinct categories.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/)

### Fundamental Principles

These principles define our core identity and purpose.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/fundamentals/)

### Culture and People Principles

These principles define how we interact with each other and our stakeholders.

-   **People First**: We believe that we work to live, not the other way around. We strive to create an empathetic, respectful, and supportive environment where our team members and clients can achieve personal and professional success.
-   **Equity**: We are committed to treating everyone with respect and equality. We avoid all forms of discrimination in our selection processes and apply positive discrimination only as a tie-breaker between equally qualified candidates to support underrepresented groups.

-   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We are a digital-first, remote-work company that prioritizes technologies and practices with a low environmental impact.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/operationals/)

## Practices

These are the established ways of working that define our culture at 23people.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/)

### Agile Management

Our management philosophy is to **manage the work, not the people**. We use a **Kanban-based system** to visualize our workflows, limit work-in-progress (WIP) to prevent overload, and focus on improving the flow of value delivery. This approach fosters autonomy, collaboration, and continuous improvement. We use **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** to align our teams with the company's strategic goals, ensuring that our autonomous efforts contribute to a unified vision.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/agile-management/)

### Communication

Effective communication is core to our collaborative culture. We prioritize:

-   **Asynchronous Communication**: To allow team members to manage their time effectively and provide thoughtful responses, reducing interruptions.
-   **Writing First**: We encourage writing down ideas before sharing them to ensure clarity and create a documented record of decisions.
-   **Structured Narratives**: When presenting initiatives or problems, we use a clear structure (**Context** -> **Response**) to ensure the message is well-understood and actionable.
-   **Prompt Acknowledgment**: We acknowledge receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce uncertainty and anxiety for the sender.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/communication/)

### Learning

We foster a culture of continuous learning by promoting a simple yet powerful technique: **learn by teaching**. This method involves selecting a topic, explaining it in simple terms as if teaching someone else, identifying and filling knowledge gaps, and refining the explanation until it is clear and concise. This process ensures deep understanding and long-term retention of knowledge.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/learning/)

### Using AI

We view Artificial Intelligence as a **capability multiplier** for our professionals. We use AI tools, such as **Claude Projects**, to automate repetitive tasks, generate initial drafts of documents, and maintain quality standards. This allows our team to focus on higher-value activities. It is a core principle that any AI-generated content is considered a **first draft** that must be reviewed, edited, and validated by a human professional to ensure accuracy, context, and quality.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/using-ai/)

## Community

### Benefits Framework

We offer a comprehensive benefits package to all team members with at least three months of seniority, designed to support their physical, mental, and professional well-being. The framework is organized into several categories:
