## Organization
### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)
23people is organized into **multidisciplinary teams** with clear, well-defined purposes. Our organizational structure is circular to foster collaboration and open communication. Each team operates with autonomy, delivering services to internal teams or external clients through defined **service contracts (APIs)**. This model emphasizes iterative improvement based on data and experience. We distinguish between **Positions (Cargos)**, which define a professional's capabilities and level, and **Roles**, which are specific, dynamic responsibilities assumed within a team or project.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)
Our operational teams are grouped under the Iarvis Tribe and are led by a **Global Operations Manager**. Each team has a **Service Request Manager (SRM)** for managing *what* and *when* and a **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)** for managing *how* and *who*.
*   **Tech Talent Services Team (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of tech professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
*   **Sales & Marketing Team (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
*   **Backoffice Team (BKO)**: Provides agile, efficient, and reliable administrative support (including People, Financial, and Company Management) to enable other teams to focus on their core functions.
*   **Research & Development Team (R&D)**: Empowers clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies to generate real business value.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)
Teams are grouped into two tribes that share common objectives:
*   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to deliver high-quality, sustainable services aligned with the company's strategic goals.
*   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all tech professionals and teams working on subcontracting arrangements for our clients. Its purpose is to ensure we have the right talent to meet client needs effectively.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)
To ensure strategic alignment and operational coordination, 23people utilizes councils:
*   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's overall strategy and ensuring operational teams are aligned with it.
*   **Iarvis Council**: Responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe, led by the Global Operations Manager.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)
Our workforce is structured around two key concepts:
*   **Positions (Cargos)**: Define a professional's level and core capabilities within the organization. A position is not tied to a specific team and signifies a level of autonomy, responsibility, and strategic impact (e.g., Intermediate, Senior).
*   **Roles**: Define a specific set of responsibilities and functions a professional undertakes in a particular context, such as within a team or project. A person in one position can perform multiple roles (e.g., a Senior Software Engineer can act as a **Tech Lead** or **Technical Interviewer**).

## Principles
### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)
1.  **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are eternal learners, constantly improving our skills with genuine curiosity. We pursue technical and professional excellence through iterative, flexible, and data-driven work.
2.  **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We co-create and support each other with honest transparency. We work as a team, sharing responsibilities and celebrating victories together. Clear, open communication is prioritized to build trust and improve productivity.
3.  **Sustainable Growth and Leadership**: We are ambitious about growing and becoming international benchmarks, but we do so at a systematic and sustainable pace that respects our people, clients, and the planet.

### Culture and People Principles (docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)
4.  **People First**: We work to live, not the other way around. We strive to create the company we always wanted to work for, prioritizing mutual benefit, empathy, and the well-being and personal success of our team members and clients.
5.  **Equity**: We believe in a humane and motivating environment where everyone is treated with respect. We avoid discrimination in our selection processes and practice positive discrimination only when choosing between equally qualified candidates to support underrepresented groups.
6.  **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction—for our clients, tech professionals, administrative staff, and suppliers. The quality of each interaction is key to building lasting relationships.

### Operational Principles (docs/principles/operationals/index.md)
7.  **Agility**: We adhere to agile values to be innovative, resilient, and efficient. We prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change over rigid plans.
8.  **Transparency**: We make information public by default, with exceptions for sensitive client, employee, or supplier data. We believe transparency fosters productivity, retention, and trust.
9.  **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision of using natural, financial, and social resources correctly. We favor remote work, digitalization, and technologies that reduce our environmental impact.

## Practices
### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)
We **manage the work, not the people**, using **Kanban** as our primary agile methodology. This practice allows us to visualize workflows, limit work-in-progress (WIP) to prevent overload, and maximize efficiency. Our Kanban boards are typically structured with five sequential areas: **Backlog**, **Requested** (committed), **In Progress**, **Done**, and **Ready to Archive**. This system promotes a focus on flow, facilitates collaboration, and enables continuous improvement by identifying and resolving bottlenecks.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)
Effective communication is key to our collaborative culture. Our practices include:
*   **Preferring Asynchronous Communication**: To allow team members to manage their time and energy efficiently, especially across different time zones.
*   **Writing Ideas Before Sharing**: We encourage writing down thoughts before communicating them to ensure clarity and foster more thoughtful responses.
*   **Acknowledging Messages Promptly**: We confirm receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce uncertainty and anxiety for the sender.
*   **Structuring Narratives**: We use a structured approach (**Context, Response**) for presenting initiatives and problems to ensure clarity and effective decision-making.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)
We promote a culture of continuous learning and use a specific technique to "learn how to learn." This involves selecting a topic, explaining it as if teaching someone else, identifying and filling knowledge gaps by returning to the source material, and simplifying the language until the concept is deeply understood and can be explained clearly.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)
We view **AI as a multiplier of professional capabilities**. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our professionals to focus on higher-value activities. It is a core principle that AI-generated content is always considered a **first draft** that must be reviewed, edited, and contextualized by a human professional to ensure accuracy and alignment with our standards.

## Community
### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)
We aim to provide benefits that support our team's physical, mental, and professional well-being. Most benefits are available to all team members with at least three months of tenure. The framework includes:
*   **Agreements**: Partnerships for services like **Betterfly** (wellness app and life insurance), banking benefits with **Banco de Chile**, and **complementary health, dental, catastrophic, and life insurance**.
*   **Incentives**: Financial bonuses for taking **vacations** (minimum 5 days), **birthday gifts** and a day off, bonuses for national holidays and Christmas, and a **Baby Shower bonus** for new parents.
*   **Refunds**: Reimbursement for expenses related to **international certifications**, online **courses**, improvements to the **home office workspace**, and the annual **influenza vaccine**.
*   **Training**: Company-sponsored **English classes** in small groups to improve language skills.

### Procedures (docs/community/procedures/administratives.md)
We maintain clear administrative procedures to ensure smooth operations. This includes documented processes for tasks like fund and expense reimbursements. We also have a guide for incorporating new members into our company's **Discord server**.

### Events (docs/community/events/index.md)
We document and celebrate our community events. Photos and videos from company activities are stored in a shared Google Drive, accessible to relevant teams, to preserve our shared memories and culture.

## Technical Guide
### Software Development Principles (docs/technical-guide/software-development/principles.md)
Our development philosophy is centered on simplifying real-world problems. Key principles include:
