## Organization
### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)
23people is organized in a **circular structure** of multidisciplinary teams to foster collaboration and communication. Each team has a clear, well-defined purpose and operates with autonomy, delivering services to other internal teams or external clients.

This internal model functions like an **API**, where each team offers a "service contract" that specifies what it delivers, what to expect, and how to request its services. Teams are expected to constantly measure the quality and operational efficiency of their services and improve them iteratively based on data and accumulated experience.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)
Our operational teams are the core of our service delivery:
-   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
-   **Backoffice (BKO)**: Provides agile and efficient administrative support in People Management, Financial Management, and Company Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
-   **Research & Development (R&D)**: Powers our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real value for their operations.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)
Teams are grouped into Tribes that share common objectives:
-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to drive the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with the company's strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Consists of all teams and professionals working on a subcontracting basis for our clients. Its purpose is to ensure we have the right talent to meet client needs effectively.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)
-   **High Council**: The strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy, ensuring all operational teams are aligned with it.
-   **Iarvis Council**: A body responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)
Our structure distinguishes between positions and roles to provide clarity and flexibility.
-   **Positions (Cargos)**: Define a professional's level of seniority and core capabilities within the organization (e.g., Intermediate, Senior). A higher level implies greater strategic autonomy and broader impact.
-   **Roles**: Define a specific scope of action and concrete responsibilities a professional undertakes in a particular context, team, or project (e.g., Tech Lead, Service Request Manager). A person can hold multiple roles.

We classify technical professionals into three main levels of seniority based on skill development and acquired learning, not just years of experience: **Entry**, **Intermediate**, and **Senior**.

## Principles
### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)
-   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are lifelong learners, continuously improving our skills with genuine curiosity and striving for technical and professional excellence.
-   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We genuinely support each other with honest transparency. We work as a team, share responsibilities, celebrate victories, and provide support during challenges.
-   **Sustainable Growth and Being a Reference**: We are ambitious about growing and becoming international benchmarks, but at a systematic and sustainable pace that respects our people, our clients, and our planet.

### Culture and People Principles (docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)
-   **People First**: We work to live, not live to work. We prioritize the well-being and professional growth of our team, fostering a respectful and empathetic environment.
-   **Equity**: We believe in treating everyone respectfully and equally, avoiding any form of discrimination in our selection processes. Talent is uniformly distributed, and our company should reflect society.
-   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction—with clients, tech professionals, administrative staff, and suppliers—to build lasting, value-based relationships.

### Operational Principles (docs/principles/operationals/index.md)
-   **Agility**: We embrace agile values to adapt quickly, foster continuous improvement, minimize waste, and remain resilient. We value individuals and interactions over processes, and responding to change over following a plan.
-   **Transparency**: We make information public by default, except for sensitive client, employee, or supplier data. We believe the benefits of trust, collaboration, and productivity outweigh the costs.
-   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision, making responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We are a 100% digital and cloud-based company, privileging remote work and technologies that reduce our environmental impact.

## Practices
### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)
We **manage the work, not the people**, using **Kanban** principles to guide our workflows. This approach allows us to visualize tasks, limit work in progress (WIP) to improve focus and flow, and maximize efficiency. Our Kanban boards are structured with clear stages (Backlog, Requested, In Progress, Done, Archive) to provide a transparent view of all activities. This system fosters a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement, allowing teams to identify bottlenecks and optimize processes based on real data.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)
Effective communication is core to our operations. We adhere to several key practices:
-   **Asynchronous-First**: We prefer asynchronous communication (e.g., written documents, messages) to allow team members to manage their time and energy efficiently, especially across different time zones.
-   **Write, Then Communicate**: We encourage writing down ideas before sharing them to promote clarity, reflection, and well-thought-out responses.
-   **Structured Narratives**: We use frameworks like SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) to structure proposals and initiatives, ensuring clear and effective communication.
-   **Acknowledge Promptly**: We confirm receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce uncertainty and anxiety for the sender.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)
We foster a culture of continuous learning. We use a simple but powerful technique for mastering new topics:
1.  **Study** the chosen topic.
2.  **Explain** it in simple terms, as if teaching someone else. This reveals knowledge gaps.
3.  **Review** and study again where you get stuck.
4.  **Simplify** the explanation further, using analogies.
If the explanation is clear and simple, the topic is truly understood.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)
We leverage AI as a **capability multiplier** for our professional teams. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to create dedicated workspaces with pre-defined instructions and context. This allows us to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our teams to focus on higher-value activities. The content generated by AI is treated as a **first draft**, which professionals must then review, edit, and enrich with their expertise and judgment. This "human-in-the-loop" approach ensures quality while boosting efficiency.

## Community
### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)
We offer a range of benefits to support our team's physical, mental, and professional well-being. Most benefits are available to all team members with at least three months of seniority. The framework is organized into several categories:
-   **Agreements**: Includes access to the **Betterfly** wellness platform, a company agreement with **Banco de Chile**, and **complementary health, dental, life, and catastrophic insurance**.
-   **Incentives**: We provide an **economic bonus for taking vacations**, a **birthday gift** and a **day off for birthdays**, monetary bonuses for **national holidays and Christmas**, and a **Baby Shower bonus** for new parents.
-   **Refunds**: We offer reimbursements for the annual **influenza vaccination**, online **courses** (up to a quarterly limit), international **certification exams**, and improvements to the **home office workspace** (up to an annual limit).
-   **Trainings**: We provide company-sponsored **English classes** in small groups to improve language skills.

### Procedures (docs/community/procedures/administratives.md)
We have documented administrative procedures to ensure consistency and clarity. These include processes for **expense reimbursement** and **fund rendering**. We also have a defined process for adding new members to our company's Discord server.

### Events (docs/community/events/index.md)
We capture moments from our company events. Official photos and videos are stored in a shared Google Drive, accessible to relevant teams like Marketing and People Growth, to preserve our shared memories and culture.
