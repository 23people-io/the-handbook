## About Us

### Who We Are (docs/about-us/who-we-are/index.md)

**23people is a technology company founded on November 26, 2014, by software engineers Marcelo Ampuero and Manuel Reyes.** The founding principle was to create a company where they themselves would want to work—a place that prioritizes people, fosters a passion for technology, and promotes continuous learning. We are a team of professionals passionate about what we do, aiming to build a sustainable business model that puts people first in our relationships with both clients and our team.

The name **"23people"** is inspired by the movie *The Matrix Reloaded*, referencing the 23 individuals selected to rebuild Zion. It represents the spirit behind those chosen to build something new outside the conventional system.

## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized in a **circular structure** of multidisciplinary teams to foster collaboration and communication. Each team operates with a clear purpose and delivers services to other internal teams or external clients through well-defined **service contracts (APIs)**. This model promotes autonomy while ensuring alignment with the company's strategic goals.

We distinguish between **Positions (Cargos)**, which define a professional's capabilities and level within the organization, and **Roles**, which are specific responsibilities assumed within a team or project. This flexibility allows professionals to apply their skills across different contexts.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)

Our operational teams are grouped under the Iarvis Tribe and are designed to function autonomously, guided by data-driven iterative improvement.

*   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of Tech Professionals who match our clients' project needs.
*   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
*   **Backoffice (BKO)**: Provides agile and efficient administrative support in People Management, Financial Management, and Company Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
*   **Research & Development (R&D)**: Drives the digital evolution of our clients by exploring, mastering, and applying emerging technologies to generate real business value.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

Teams are grouped into two **Tribes** that share common objectives:

*   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to drive the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with strategic goals.
*   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all professionals and teams working in outsourcing arrangements for our clients, whether as dedicated teams or as individual contributors.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

Strategic and operational alignment is facilitated through councils:

*   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy, ensuring all operational teams are aligned with it.
*   **Iarvis Council**: An operational body, led by the Global Operations Manager, that coordinates and aligns the Iarvis Tribe teams, translating strategic goals into operational initiatives.

### Workforce Structure (docs/about-us/how-we-work/tech-roles.md)

Our workforce is structured by professional seniority, which we measure by skill development and acquired learning, not by years of experience.

*   **Entry**: A professional starting their career, requiring guidance to complete tasks efficiently. They demonstrate a continuous learning capacity and proactively seek help.
*   **Intermediate**: A professional with proven experience who serves as a reference for others. They handle responsibilities confidently and are developing their ability to align technical solutions with business goals.
*   **Senior**: A professional with extensive experience and deep knowledge, acting as an undisputed reference in best practices. They can take on roles like Tech Lead, Team Lead, Specialist, or Architect, and are responsible for effort and resource estimations.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

We **manage the work, not the people**. Our approach is centered on visual and systematic workflows using **Kanban** principles. This allows us to visualize work, limit work-in-progress (WIP) to maximize efficiency, and foster a culture of continuous improvement. We focus on how work gets done, promoting collaboration, autonomy, and team responsibility.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/asynchronous-communication.md)

We prioritize **asynchronous communication** to allow collaborators to manage their time and energy effectively, reducing interruptions. We encourage writing down ideas before sharing them to foster clarity and reflection. Key practices include acknowledging messages promptly to reduce uncertainty and using a structured narrative (Context, Question, Answer) for presenting initiatives to ensure clarity.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We follow a technique for **learning how to learn**. This involves selecting a topic, explaining it simply as if teaching someone else, identifying knowledge gaps and restudying them, and simplifying the language until the concept is deeply understood. This method ensures robust and long-lasting comprehension.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

We use AI as a **professional capability multiplier**. We leverage tools like **Claude Projects** to create dedicated workspaces with predefined instructions and context. This allows our teams to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and focus on higher-value activities. All AI-generated content is treated as a first draft that requires professional review and refinement.
