## Organization

### Overview

23people is organized into **multidisciplinary teams** with a circular structure to foster collaboration. Each team operates with a clear purpose and delivers services to other internal teams or external clients through a well-defined **service contract**, similar to an API. This model emphasizes team autonomy, purpose-driven work, and iterative, data-based improvement. The operational teams are collectively grouped under the **Iarvis Tribe**. Strategic alignment is maintained by the **High Council**, which defines and communicates the organization's overall strategy.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

### Teams

There are four core operational teams, each with a distinct purpose:

-   **Tech Talent Services (TTS):** Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of tech professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for client projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT):** Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
-   **Backoffice (BKO):** Provides agile and efficient administrative support in people management, financial management, and company management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
-   **Research & Development (R&D):** Drives the digital evolution of clients by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real value.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

### Tribes

The organization uses the concept of **Tribes** to group teams with shared objectives:

-   **Iarvis Tribe:** Comprises all the operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D) that work together to deliver high-quality, sustainable services aligned with the company's strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe:** Includes all tech professionals and teams working in an outsourcing model for clients, forming the core of service delivery.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/tribes/)

### Councils

The strategic direction and operational alignment are managed through councils. The **High Council** is the strategic team responsible for defining the organization's strategy and ensuring that operational teams are aligned with it. The operational teams are coordinated and aligned through the **Iarvis Council**, which is led by the Global Operations Manager.

(https://manual.23people.io/organization/)

### Workforce Structure

23people distinguishes between **Cargos (Positions)** and **Roles**. A **Cargo** defines a professional's hierarchical level, responsibilities, and expected behaviors within the organization. A **Role** is a specific set of functions a person performs within a particular team or project. A single Cargo can encompass multiple Roles, allowing for flexibility and internal mobility.

Key operational roles include:

-   **Global Operations Manager:** Orchestrates the execution of the Iarvis Tribe teams, aligning them with strategic objectives.
-   **Service Request Manager (SRM):** Manages the "what" and "when" of service requests, acting as the primary interface with the client.
-   **Service Delivery Manager (SDM):** Defines the "how" and "who" of service execution, managing the internal workflow and ensuring quality delivery.

-   **Sustainable Growth and Being a Benchmark:** An ambition to grow and become an international reference, but at a systematic and sustainable pace that does not compromise the well-being of the team, clients, or the planet.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/fundamentals/)

### Culture and People Principles

These principles guide interactions and relationships.

-   **People First:** The belief that "we work to live, not live to work." 23people aims to be a company that serves human needs, prioritizes well-being, and fosters a respectful, collaborative environment.
-   **Equity:** A commitment to treating everyone respectfully and equally. The company avoids discrimination in its selection processes and applies positive discrimination only as a tie-breaker between equally qualified candidates to support underrepresented groups.
-   **Xperience:** A focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences for everyone who interacts with the company, including clients, tech professionals, administrative staff, and suppliers.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/culture-and-people/)

### Operational Principles

These principles shape how the company works and operates.

-   **Agility:** Adherence to agile values to be an innovative, resilient, and efficient organization. This includes prioritizing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
-   **Transparency:** A "public by default" approach to information and processes, with exceptions only for sensitive data related to clients, employees, and suppliers. This fosters trust, productivity, and collaboration.
-   **Sustainability:** A long-term vision committed to the proper use of natural, financial, and social resources. This is reflected in practices like favoring remote work, being 100% digital and cloud-based, and choosing technology partners with strong environmental commitments.

(https://manual.23people.io/principles/operationals/)

## Practices

### Agile Management

23people's approach to agile management is centered on the principle of **"managing the work, not the people."** This is implemented using the **Kanban** methodology to visualize workflows, limit work in progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency.

Work is organized on Kanban boards divided into five sequential areas: **Backlog Area** (for unrefined ideas), **Requested Area** (committed work ready for execution), **In Progress Area** (active work), **Done Area** (completed work), and **Ready to Archive Area**. This structure provides a clear view of all activities, helps prioritize tasks, and ensures team alignment. Daily meetings are conducted by reviewing the board from right to left (from "Done" backwards) to prioritize finishing tasks over starting new ones.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/agile-management/)

### Communication

Effective and collaborative communication is guided by several key practices:

-   **Prefer Asynchronous Communication:** To allow team members to manage their time and energy efficiently, reduce interruptions, and foster more thoughtful responses.
-   **Write Then Communicate:** Ideas should be written down and clarified before being shared. This improves clarity and provides a record of decisions.
-   **Acknowledge Messages Promptly:** Confirming receipt of a message as soon as possible helps reduce anxiety and uncertainty for the sender.
-   **Structure the Narrative:** Initiatives and problems should be presented using a consistent structure (Context, Complication, Question, Answer) to ensure clear and effective communication.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/communication/)

### Learning

23people promotes a culture of continuous improvement and effective learning. The company advocates for a five-step technique to master new topics:

1.  **Select and Study:** Choose a topic and begin studying it.
2.  **Explain as if Teaching:** Write and speak about the topic as if explaining it to someone else. This helps identify knowledge gaps.
3.  **Restudy When Stuck:** Return to the source material to fill in any gaps identified during the explanation phase.
4.  **Simplify Language:** Repeat the explanation process using simpler language or analogies to ensure deep understanding.
5.  **Review for Clarity:** If the explanation is still confusing, it indicates incomplete understanding, and the process should be repeated.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/learning/)

### Using AI

Artificial Intelligence is viewed as a **"professional capabilities multiplier."** Tools like **Claude Projects** are used to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up professionals to focus on higher-value activities. It is a core principle that AI-generated content is always considered a **draft or starting point**. A human professional is responsible for reviewing, editing, and adding context to ensure the final output meets company standards. This approach leverages AI to enhance productivity while maintaining human oversight and professional judgment.

(https://manual.23people.io/practices/using-ai/)

## Community

### Benefits Framework

23people offers a range of benefits aimed at improving the physical, mental, and professional well-being of its team. Eligibility for most benefits begins after **three months of seniority**. The framework is designed to be clear and accessible to everyone in the company.

Benefits are categorized as follows:
