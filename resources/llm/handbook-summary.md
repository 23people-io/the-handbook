## Organization
### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)
23people is organized in a **circular structure** to foster collaboration and communication. Our model is built on the concept of **teams as service providers**. Each team has a clear purpose and operates with autonomy, offering its services to other internal teams or external clients through well-defined service contracts, much like a technical **API**. This model allows for scalability and efficiency, with each team responsible for continuously improving its services based on data and experience.

### Teams (docs/organization/teams/index.md)
Our operational teams are designed to be multidisciplinary and autonomous, each with a distinct purpose. The primary operational teams are:

-   **Tech Talent Services Team (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of tech professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing Team (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand, presence, and market share.
-   **Backoffice Services Team (BKO)**: Provides agile and efficient administrative support in People Management, Financial Management, and Company Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
-   **Research & Development Services Team (R&D)**: Powers the digital evolution of our clients by exploring and mastering emerging technologies to generate real value in their operations.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)
We group teams with shared objectives into **Tribes**. This structure helps to align efforts and foster a sense of shared identity. There are two main tribes:

-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D), working together to drive the company's core functions and strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Consists of all professionals and teams working on a subcontracting basis for our clients, forming the core of our service delivery to external partners.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)
To ensure strategic alignment and operational coordination, we have established councils:

-   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's overall strategy, ensuring that all operational teams are aligned with long-term goals.
-   **Iarvis Council**: Composed of members from the Iarvis Tribe, this council is responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams, facilitated by the Global Operations Manager.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/workforce/positions/index.md)
Our workforce is structured around two key concepts: **Cargos (Positions)** and **Roles**.

-   A **Cargo** represents a formal, relatively permanent position within the organization's structure. It defines a career path and the fundamental competencies required, and it can contain multiple roles.
-   A **Role** is a more dynamic and flexible assignment that defines a specific scope of action and responsibilities within a particular context, such as a team or project. For example, a person with the *Senior Software Engineer* cargo might take on the *Tech Lead* role in a project.

We also define seniority levels—**Entry**, **Intermediate**, and **Senior**—based on the demonstrated development of skills and acquired learning, rather than years of experience.

## Principles
### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)
-   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are lifelong learners who pursue excellence in our work, constantly improving our skills with genuine curiosity.
-   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We support each other with honest transparency and clear communication, growing our human and professional skills together as a team.
-   **Grow Sustainably and Be Referents**: We are ambitious about growing and becoming international benchmarks, but we do so at a sustainable pace that respects our team, our clients, and our planet.

### Culture and People Principles (docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)
-   **People First**: We work to live, not live to work. We prioritize the well-being and personal success of our team members and clients, fostering a respectful and empathetic environment.
-   **Equity**: We believe in treating everyone with respect and equality, avoiding discrimination of any kind in our selection and promotion processes. We value talent wherever it is found.

### Operational Principles (docs/principles/operationals/index.md)
-   **Agility**: We embrace agile values to adapt quickly, foster continuous improvement, collaborate effectively, and respond to change over rigidly following a plan.
-   **Transparency**: We make information public by default, excluding sensitive client, employee, or supplier data, believing it fosters trust, collaboration, and productivity.
-   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that involves the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources, promoting remote work and digital processes to minimize our environmental impact.

## Practices
### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)
We manage our work, not our people, using a system based on **Kanban** principles. This involves visualizing work on boards, limiting work in progress (WIP) to prevent overload, and focusing on a smooth flow of tasks. Workflows are typically structured into areas like **Backlog**, **Requested**, **In Progress**, **Done**, and **Archive**. This approach allows for flexibility, transparency, and continuous improvement, empowering teams to self-organize and deliver value efficiently.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)
We prioritize **asynchronous communication** to allow team members to manage their time effectively and reduce interruptions. We also follow a structured narrative approach, based on the SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) framework and the Pyramid Principle, to present ideas and initiatives clearly. This ensures that communication is effective, contextualized, and leads with the main conclusion.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)
We promote a "learn to learn" technique that involves selecting a topic, explaining it as if teaching it to someone else, identifying and filling knowledge gaps, and simplifying the language until the concept is deeply understood. This method fosters a profound and lasting understanding, aligning with our value of intellectual curiosity.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)
We use AI as a **capability multiplier**. Specifically, we utilize **Claude Projects** to create dedicated workspaces with predefined instructions and context. This helps automate repetitive tasks like drafting documents or creating Kanban card descriptions, saving time, ensuring consistency, and allowing our professionals to focus on higher-value activities. All AI-generated content is treated as a first draft that requires professional review and refinement.

## Community
### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)
We offer a range of benefits aimed at improving the physical, mental, and professional well-being of our team members. These benefits generally become available after a three-month ramp-up period. The framework includes:
