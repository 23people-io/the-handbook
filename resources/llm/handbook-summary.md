## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized into **multidisciplinary teams** with a circular structure to foster collaboration. Each team operates with a clear purpose and autonomy, delivering services to internal teams or external clients through well-defined service contracts, much like an **API**. Key operational principles for teams include having a clear purpose, autonomy, fulfilling purpose through service contracts, and data-driven iterative improvement.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)

Our operational teams are grouped within the Iarvis Tribe and are led by a **Global Operations Manager**.

*   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best fit for our clients' projects.
*   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
*   **Backoffice (BKO)**: Provides agile and efficient administrative support in People Management, Financial Management, and Company Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
*   **Research & Development (R&D)**: Drives clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that create real business value.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

Teams are grouped into two **Tribes** that share common objectives:

*   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to drive the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with strategic goals.
*   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all teams and professionals working on a subcontracting basis for client projects. Its purpose is to ensure we have the right talent to meet client needs.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

*   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy and ensuring operational teams are aligned with it.
*   **Iarvis Council**: Responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)

We distinguish between **Positions (Cargos)** and **Roles**.
*   A **Position** defines a professional's level and core competencies within the organization's hierarchy.
*   A **Role** defines a specific set of responsibilities a professional undertakes in a particular context, such as a team or project.

This flexible structure allows a professional in a single position (e.g., Senior Software Engineer) to perform different roles (e.g., Tech Lead, Technical Interviewer) across various teams. Key operational roles include:

*   **Global Operations Manager**: Orchestrates the operational execution of the Iarvis Tribe teams.
*   **Service Request Manager (SRM)**: Manages the "what" and "when" of service requests, acting as the primary interface with the client.
*   **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**: Defines the "how" and "who" for service execution, ensuring quality and efficiency in delivery.

## Principles

8.  **Transparency**: We make information public by default, with exceptions for sensitive client, employee, or supplier data. We believe transparency fosters productivity, trust, and collaboration.
9.  **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We favor remote work, digitalization, and technologies that reduce our environmental impact.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

We manage **work, not people**, using **Kanban** principles to visualize workflows and maximize efficiency. Our process includes:
*   **Visual Workflows**: Using Kanban boards with distinct areas (Backlog, Requested, In Progress, Done, Archive).
*   **WIP Limits**: Limiting work-in-progress to prevent overload and encourage focus on finishing tasks.
*   **Daily Meetings**: A structured daily sync to review board progress from right to left (Done to Requested), manage blockages, and define the day's focus.
*   **Documenting Decisions**: We prefer to document decisions rather than leaving them in people's memory to ensure clarity and persistence.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

*   **Asynchronous-First**: We prefer asynchronous communication to allow collaborators to manage their time effectively and provide thoughtful responses.
*   **Write Then Communicate**: We encourage writing down ideas to clarify them before sharing, which improves the quality of communication.
*   **Structured Narrative**: We use frameworks like SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) to structure proposals and initiatives for clear and effective communication.
*   **Acknowledge Promptly**: We acknowledge receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce ambiguity and anxiety.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We follow a technique for effective learning:
1.  Select and study a topic.
2.  Explain it aloud as if teaching someone else to identify knowledge gaps.
3.  Return to studying when encountering difficulties.
4.  Simplify the language and use analogies.
5.  Review for clarity; if it's confusing, the topic isn't fully understood yet.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

We use AI, specifically **Claude Projects**, as a capability multiplier. This allows us to create dedicated workspaces with pre-defined instructions to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our teams to focus on high-value activities. The generated content is always treated as a draft that requires professional review and refinement.

## Community
