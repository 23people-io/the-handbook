## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized into **multidisciplinary teams** with a circular structure to foster collaboration and communication. Each team has a clear, well-defined purpose and operates with autonomy, delivering services to other internal teams or external clients.

Teams function with a **service contract model**, similar to an API, which specifies what the service delivers, what to expect, and how to request it. This model promotes clarity and accountability. Each team is responsible for iteratively improving its services based on data and accumulated experience.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)

Our operational teams are the core of our service delivery:

*   **Tech Talent Services (TTS)**: Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for our clients' projects.
*   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
*   **Backoffice (BKO)**: Provides agile, efficient, and reliable administrative support in People Management, Financial Management, and Company Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
*   **Research & Development (R&D)**: Drives our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies to generate real value in their operations.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

Teams are grouped into two **Tribes** that share common objectives:

*   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to drive the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with the company's strategic goals.
*   **Drakkar Tribe**: Consists of all teams and professionals working on a subcontracting basis for our clients. Its purpose is to ensure we have the right talent to meet client needs effectively.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

Strategic and operational alignment is managed through councils:

*   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy, ensuring that all operational teams are aligned with it.
*   **Iarvis Council**: Responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe, led by the Global Operations Manager.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)

Our structure is based on a clear distinction between **Positions (Cargos)** and **Roles**:

*   **Positions** define a professional's level and capabilities within the organization, indicating their career progression. They are not tied to a specific team.
*   **Roles** define specific responsibilities and functions within a particular context, such as a team or project. A single person can hold multiple roles.

Key roles include:

*   **Global Operations Manager**: Orchestrates the operational execution of the Iarvis Tribe teams, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives.
*   **Service Request Manager (SRM)**: Manages the "what" and "when" of service requests, acting as the primary interface with the client and defining priorities.
*   **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**: Defines the "how" and "who" executes each service, ensuring quality and efficiency in delivery by managing the workflow.

Professional seniority is defined by skill development, not years of experience, across three levels: **Entry**, **Intermediate**, and **Senior**.

## Principles

### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)

*   **Transparency**: We make information public by default, except for sensitive client, employee, or supplier data. We believe transparency fosters productivity, trust, and retention.
*   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision, making responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We prioritize remote work, digitalization, and technologies that reduce our environmental impact.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

We **manage the work, not the people**, using **Kanban** principles to visualize workflows, limit work in progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. Our Kanban boards are typically organized into five sequential areas: **Backlog Area** (unrefined items), **Requested Area** (committed items ready for execution), **In Progress Area** (active work), **Done Area** (completed items), and **Ready to Archive Area**. This system fosters a collaborative environment focused on continuous flow and improvement.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

Effective and collaborative communication is key to our success.

*   **Prefer Asynchronous Communication**: We prioritize asynchronous communication to allow collaborators to manage their time efficiently, reduce interruptions, and provide thoughtful responses.
*   **Write Then Communicate**: We encourage writing down ideas before sharing them to ensure clarity, facilitate informed decision-making, and create a record.
*   **Structure the Narrative**: We use a structured approach (Context, Question, Answer) to present initiatives and problems, ensuring clear and effective communication based on the Pyramid Principle.
*   **Acknowledge Promptly**: We acknowledge receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce anxiety and confirm that communication has been received.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We follow a technique for effective learning:
1.  Select and study a topic.
2.  Explain it as if teaching someone else to identify knowledge gaps.
3.  Return to studying to fill those gaps.
4.  Simplify the language and use analogies to clarify.
5.  Review for clarity; if it's confusing, the topic isn't fully understood yet.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

We use AI, specifically **Claude Projects**, as a **capability multiplier** to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our teams to focus on high-value activities. Claude Projects are dedicated workspaces with pre-defined instructions that help generate standardized drafts for tasks like creating Kanban cards or documenting processes. All AI-generated content is treated as a starting point and must be reviewed, edited, and validated by our professionals.

## Community

### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)

We aim to provide benefits that support the physical, mental, and professional well-being of everyone at 23people. Eligibility for most benefits begins after three months of employment. Our benefits are structured into several categories:

*   **Agreements**: Partnerships that provide access to services like **Betterfly** (wellness app with life insurance), **Banco de Chile** (preferential banking plans), and **Complementary Insurance** (health, dental, catastrophic, and life insurance).
*   **Incentives**: Monetary and non-monetary rewards, including a **Vacation Bonus** for taking weekly blocks of vacation, a **Birthday Gift** and a **day off for your birthday**, and bonuses for **National Holidays and Christmas**. We also offer a **Baby Shower Bonus** for new parents with at least one year of tenure.
