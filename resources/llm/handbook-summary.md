## About Us

### Who We Are (docs/about-us/who-we-are/index.md)

**23people is a technology company founded on November 26, 2014, in Santiago, Chile, by software engineers Marcelo Ampuero (Engineering Director) and Manuel Reyes (General Director).** The founding principle was to create a company where they themselves would want to work—a place that puts people first, values passion for technology, and fosters continuous learning. We are a team of professionals dedicated to creating a sustainable business model that benefits our clients, our team, and society.

The name **"23people"** is inspired by the movie *The Matrix Reloaded*, referencing the 23 individuals selected to rebuild Zion, symbolizing the spirit of those chosen to build something new outside the conventional system. Over its history, the company has grown to approximately 90 active professionals and has had over 500 professionals contribute to its journey, serving more than 10 large companies across Latin America, North America, and Europe.

## Organization

### Overview (docs/organization/index.md)

23people is organized in a **circular structure** of multidisciplinary teams to foster collaboration. Each team operates with autonomy around a well-defined purpose and delivers services to internal teams or external clients through service contracts, similar to an **API**. This model allows teams to focus on their core purpose while ensuring alignment with the company's strategic goals, which are set by the **High Council**. Teams are expected to measure their service quality and operational efficiency to drive iterative, data-based improvements.

### Teams (docs/organization/index.md)

We have four core operational teams:

-   **Tech Talent Services (TTS):** Delivers the best experience in the selection, validation, and retention of Tech Professionals who are passionate about technology and are the best match for client projects.
-   **Sales & Marketing (SMKT):** Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing existing commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
-   **Backoffice (BKO):** Provides agile and efficient administrative support in Company Management, Accounting & Tax, and People Management, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions.
-   **Research & Development (R&D):** Powers our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that generate real business value.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

Teams are grouped into two **Tribes** that share common objectives:

-   **Iarvis Tribe:** Comprises all internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D) responsible for powering the company's service delivery and strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe:** Includes all tech professionals and teams working on subcontracting arrangements for our clients, forming the core of our talent delivery service.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

Strategic alignment and operational coordination are facilitated by councils:

-   **High Council:** A strategic team that defines and communicates the organization's strategy, ensuring all operational teams are aligned with it.
-   **Iarvis Council:** Defined by the Global Operations Manager, this council is in charge of the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)

Our workforce is structured around **Positions (Cargos)** and **Roles**. A **Position** defines a professional's level and capabilities, while a **Role** defines their specific responsibilities within a team or project context. This flexible structure allows a professional to hold one position (e.g., Senior Software Engineer) while performing different roles (e.g., Tech Lead, Technical Interviewer) across various teams.

Key roles include:

-   **Global Operations Manager:** Orchestrates the operational execution of the Iarvis Tribe, aligning it with strategic objectives.
-   **Service Request Manager (SRM):** Manages the "what" and "when" of service requests, acting as the primary interface with clients.
-   **Service Delivery Manager (SDM):** Defines the "how" and "who" for service execution, managing the workflow to ensure quality and efficiency.

## Principles

### Fundamental Principles (docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)

-   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity:** We are perpetual learners who pursue excellence in our work. We embrace an iterative, data-driven approach to consolidate what we learn and teach others.
-   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication:** We support each other as a team, sharing responsibilities and celebrating victories together. We prioritize honest, transparent communication to build trust and improve productivity.
-   **Grow Sustainably and Be a Benchmark:** We are ambitious about economic growth and becoming international leaders, but we do so at a sustainable pace that respects our people, clients, and the planet. We prefer systematic progress over short-term, exhausting efforts.

### Culture and People Principles (docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)

-   **People First:** We work to live, not live to work. We prioritize mutual benefit, empathy, and the well-being and professional growth of our team and clients.
-   **Equity:** We believe in treating everyone with respect and equality. We avoid all forms of discrimination in our selection processes, focusing on talent and potential.

-   **Transparency:** We make information public by default, with exceptions for sensitive client, employee, or supplier data. We believe the benefits of trust and productivity outweigh the costs.
-   **Sustainability:** We are committed to a long-term vision, making responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We are a 100% digital and remote-first company to minimize our environmental impact.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

We **manage the work, not the people**, using a Kanban-based system to visualize workflows and maximize efficiency. Our boards are typically structured into five sequential areas: **Backlog**, **Requested**, **In Progress**, **Done**, and **Ready to Archive**. This approach allows us to limit work-in-progress (WIP), identify bottlenecks, and foster a culture of continuous improvement. We also use **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** to align our work with strategic goals.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

Effective communication is key to our collaborative culture. We follow several key practices:

-   **Prefer Asynchronous Communication:** To allow for focused work and respect different schedules.
-   **Write Ideas Before Sharing:** To ensure clarity and thoughtfulness in our discussions.
-   **Structure Narratives:** We use frameworks like SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) to present initiatives and problems clearly, starting with context and following with a structured response.
-   **Acknowledge Messages Promptly:** To reduce uncertainty and anxiety in communication.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We foster a culture of continuous learning. A key technique we promote is to **learn by teaching**: select a topic, explain it as if teaching someone else, identify knowledge gaps, study to fill them, and simplify the explanation until it is crystal clear. This method ensures deep and lasting understanding.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

We view AI as a **multiplier of professional capabilities**. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to create dedicated workspaces with pre-defined instructions for recurring tasks. This helps automate repetitive work, maintain quality standards, and free up our team to focus on higher-value activities. The AI-generated content serves as a starting draft that professionals must review, edit, and enrich with their expertise.

## Community

### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)

We offer a range of benefits to support our team's physical, mental, and professional well-being, generally available to everyone with at least three months of seniority.
