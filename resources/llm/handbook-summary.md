-   **Sales & Marketing Team (SMKT)**: Responsible for acquiring new clients, managing current commercial relationships, and growing the 23people brand and market presence.
-   **Backoffice Team (BKO)**: Provides the best administrative support, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions through agile and efficient management of people, finances, and company operations.
-   **Research & Development Team (R&D)**: Drives our clients' digital evolution by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that create real value in their operations.

### Tribes
(docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

We use the concept of **Tribes** to group teams with shared objectives. This structure helps align efforts and foster a common identity.

-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all of 23people's internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to deliver high-quality, sustainable services aligned with the company's strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all tech professionals and teams working on a subcontracting basis for our clients. Its purpose is to ensure we have the right talent to meet client needs effectively.

### Councils
(docs/organization/index.md)

Councils are strategic and coordination bodies that ensure alignment across the organization.

-   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the company's overall strategy and ensuring that operational teams are aligned with it.
-   **Iarvis Council**: A body responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe, led by the Global Operations Manager.

### Workforce Structure
(docs/organization/workforce/positions/index.md)

Our structure distinguishes between **Positions (Cargos)** and **Roles**. A **Position** defines a professional's level of seniority and core competencies (e.g., Senior Software Engineer), while a **Role** defines specific responsibilities within a particular team or project (e.g., Tech Lead).

We primarily focus on four main categories of technical roles, each with defined seniority levels (**Entry, Intermediate, Senior**):

-   **Software Engineers**: Build, maintain, and test enterprise software applications (Fullstack, Frontend, Backend, QA).
-   **Data Engineers**: Design and implement systems for processing and managing large volumes of data.
-   **Cloud Engineers**: Design, implement, and optimize cloud infrastructure (DevOps, SRE, Cloud Architects).
-   **AI Engineers**: Develop algorithms and models for AI-driven solutions (Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers).

## Principles
### Fundamental Principles
(docs/principles/fundamentals/index.md)

These principles form the core of our identity and guide all our actions.

-   **Excellence and Intellectual Curiosity**: We are lifelong learners who pursue excellence in everything we do. We embrace a mindset of continuous improvement and are passionate about technology.
-   **Collaboration and Assertive Communication**: We work as a team, supporting each other and our clients with honesty and transparency. We prioritize clear communication to build trust and enhance productivity.
-   **Sustainable Growth and Leadership**: We are ambitious about growing and becoming an international reference, but we do so at a sustainable pace that respects our people, our clients, and our planet.

### Culture and People Principles
(docs/principles/culture-and-people/index.md)

These principles define our interactions and commitment to our community.

-   **People First**: We believe in working to live, not living to work. We strive to create a supportive environment where people are respected and their well-being is a priority.
-   **Equity**: We are committed to treating everyone with respect and equality. We avoid discrimination in our selection processes, focusing on talent and potential, and apply positive discrimination only as a tie-breaker to support underrepresented groups.
-   **Xperience**: We focus on creating meaningful and memorable experiences in every interaction—with clients, tech professionals, administrative staff, and suppliers—to build lasting and valuable relationships.

### Operational Principles
(docs/principles/operationals/index.md)

These principles guide our daily work and organizational processes.

-   **Agility**: We embrace agile principles to be innovative, resilient, and efficient. We prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
-   **Transparency**: We make information public by default, excluding only sensitive client, employee, or supplier data. This fosters trust, productivity, and collaboration.
-   **Sustainability**: We are committed to a long-term vision that ensures the responsible use of natural, financial, and social resources. We favor remote work, digitalization, and technologies that minimize our environmental impact.

## Practices
### Agile Management
(docs/practices/agile-management/workflows-manage-work-not-people.md)

We follow the principle of **"manage the work, not the people."** We use **Kanban** to visualize our workflows on boards, which helps us manage tasks, limit work-in-progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. This approach fosters a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement by focusing on the process rather than individual management. We also use **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** to align our work with strategic goals and prefer to document decisions to create a shared source of truth.

### Communication
(docs/practices/communication/index.md)

Effective communication is key to our success, especially in a remote-first environment.

-   **Asynchronous Communication is Preferred**: We prioritize asynchronous communication to allow collaborators to manage their time effectively and reduce interruptions. This also creates a written record of discussions.
-   **Write, Then Communicate**: We encourage writing down ideas before sharing them to ensure clarity and foster thoughtful responses.
-   **Structured Narratives**: We use frameworks like SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) to structure proposals and initiatives, ensuring they are clear, concise, and effective.
-   **Acknowledge Promptly**: We acknowledge receipt of messages as soon as possible to reduce anxiety and confirm that the communication has been received.

### Learning
(docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We foster a culture of continuous learning. We advocate for a technique similar to the Feynman method:
1.  Choose a topic to study.
2.  Explain it simply, as if teaching someone else, to identify knowledge gaps.
3.  Return to the material to fill those gaps.
4.  Simplify the language and use analogies to deepen understanding.
This process ensures a profound and lasting comprehension of new concepts.

### Using AI
(docs/practices/using-ai/claude-project.md)

We view AI as a **professional capabilities multiplier**. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our professionals to focus on higher-value activities. The AI-generated content serves as a **first draft**, which our team members must review, edit, and enrich with their professional judgment. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures quality while leveraging the efficiency of AI. We strictly prohibit the use of sensitive or confidential information in AI tools.

## Community
### Benefits Framework
(docs/community/benefits/index.md)

We offer a range of benefits designed to support the physical, mental, and professional well-being of our team. Eligibility for most benefits begins after a three-month ramp-up period. The framework includes:

-   **Agreements**: Partnerships that provide access to services like **Betterfly** (well-being app and life insurance), a company plan with **Banco de Chile**, and **complementary health, dental, and life insurance**.
-   **Incentives**: Financial bonuses and perks, including an **incentive for taking full weeks of vacation**, a **birthday gift and a day off**, bonuses for national holidays (**Fiestas Patrias and Christmas**), and a **baby shower bonus** for new parents.
-   **Refunds**: Reimbursement policies for expenses such as the annual **influenza vaccination**, professional development **courses**, **international certifications**, and improvements to the **home office workspace**.
-   **Trainings**: Company-sponsored training programs, such as **English classes**, to support professional growth.
