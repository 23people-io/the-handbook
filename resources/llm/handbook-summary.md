-   **Backoffice Team (BKO)**: Provides the best administrative support, enabling other teams to focus on their core functions through agile and efficient management of people, finances, and company administration.
-   **Research & Development Team (R&D)**: Drives the digital evolution of our clients by exploring and mastering emerging technologies that create real value in their operations.

### Tribes (docs/organization/tribes/index.md)

Teams are grouped into two **Tribes** that share common objectives:

-   **Iarvis Tribe**: Comprises all internal operational teams (TTS, SMKT, BKO, R&D). Its purpose is to power the delivery of high-quality, sustainable services aligned with 23people's strategic goals.
-   **Drakkar Tribe**: Includes all teams and professionals working on a subcontracting basis for clients. Its purpose is to ensure 23people has the right talent to meet client needs effectively.

### Councils (docs/organization/index.md)

Strategic alignment and coordination are facilitated by councils:

-   **High Council**: A strategic team responsible for defining and communicating the organization's strategy, ensuring that all operational teams are aligned with it.
-   **Iarvis Council**: Responsible for the coordination and alignment of the operational teams within the Iarvis Tribe, supporting the Global Operations Manager.

### Workforce Structure (docs/organization/index.md)

Our workforce is structured around two complementary concepts:

-   **Positions (Cargos)**: Define the level of responsibility, expected impact, and career progression within the company. A position is a formal title that reflects a professional's seniority and strategic contribution.
-   **Roles**: Define a specific scope of action and concrete responsibilities that a professional assumes in a particular context, such as a team or project. A single position can encompass multiple roles. For example, a Senior Software Engineer (position) can perform the role of a Tech Lead.

Professional seniority is categorized into three main levels: **Entry**, **Intermediate**, and **Senior**, based on skill development and acquired learning, not just years of experience.

## Practices

### Agile Management (docs/practices/agile-management/index.md)

We manage **work, not people**, using principles and practices from **Kanban** to create visual and systematic workflows. This approach allows us to maintain a clear view of all activities, limit work-in-progress (WIP) to improve flow, and foster an environment of continuous improvement. We use **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** to align our work with strategic goals. Our daily meetings follow a structured algorithm focused on finishing work before starting new tasks, managing blockers, and maintaining team focus.

### Communication (docs/practices/communication/index.md)

Effective and collaborative communication is key to our success. We prioritize **asynchronous communication** to allow for focused work and thoughtful responses. We encourage team members to **write down their ideas before sharing them** to ensure clarity and provide a documented record. When presenting initiatives or problems, we use a structured narrative (**Context-Question-Answer**) to ensure the message is clear, logical, and effective.

### Learning (docs/practices/learning/how-to-learn.md)

We foster a culture of continuous learning. A key technique we promote is to **learn by teaching**. This involves selecting a topic, studying it, explaining it in simple terms as if teaching someone else, identifying knowledge gaps, and repeating the process until the concept is deeply understood. This method ensures profound comprehension and long-term retention of knowledge.

### Using AI (docs/practices/using-ai/index.md)

We leverage AI as a **professional capability multiplier**. We use tools like **Claude Projects** to automate repetitive tasks, maintain quality standards, and free up our professionals to focus on higher-value activities. The content generated by AI is treated as a **starting point** or draft, which always requires professional review, editing, and contextualization to ensure accuracy and alignment with our standards.

## Community

### Benefits Framework (docs/community/benefits/index.md)

We offer a range of benefits to support the physical, mental, and professional well-being of our team members. Most benefits are available to everyone at 23people with at least three months of seniority. The framework is designed to be comprehensive and supportive.
