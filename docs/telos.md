# 23people Company Telos

## Document Purpose

This document captures the Telos (Deep Context) for 23people, a technology company based in Santiago, Chile, serving clients across three continents. This is part of our organizational context that will be used to answer questions and create artifacts for the company, including strategic decisions, quarterly reports, project prioritization, investment recommendations, and other such decisions.

The conceptual path is Problems → Mission → Narratives → Goals → Challenges → Strategies → Projects → Journal. This means that any project we're doing can be mapped all the way back to the problem(s) we're trying to solve, giving us transparency and explainability in everything we do.

## Company History

23people was founded in 2014 with the dream of creating the company where we would have loved to work. We started as a place at the service of human beings, surrounded by people passionate about technology and continuous learning.

Over the years, we have grown to more than 90 active professionals (and more than 500 throughout our history), working with clients on three continents across approximately 100 projects. We've evolved from a simple staff augmentation company to a comprehensive technology partner specializing in three complementary service lines.

The company was built on the principle that "we work to live, not live to work," establishing a human-centered approach to technology consulting.

## Company Telos (Purpose of Existence)

**23people exists to facilitate meaningful technological evolution for businesses and professionals, creating lasting value through human-centered excellence in technology.**

We believe that behind every technological challenge is a human story, and that the future is built by recognizing that people are not disposable resources. Our fundamental purpose is to be part of positive change in people's lives - both our clients and our professionals.
